Methods We longitudinally sampled plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at different time points from one HIV-1 infected patient. The evolution of viral quasispecies was inferred from viral phylogenies. Results Prior to treatment, no drug resistant mutations were found in this patient's plasma, and all viruses had CCR5 tropism. Two months after treatment, the majority of ...   \n",
       "1  Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA) syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary conjugate saccadic eye movements, myoclonus, and ataxia. Few reports exist on patients with HIV and OMA. A 41-year-old man diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 1997 coursed with multiple anti-retroviral schemes as a consequence of poor adherence. In 2008 he presented an HIV-1 viral load of 100,000 copies/mL and a CD4+ T cell count of 10 cells/mm3. In 2013 our patient arrived with an 11-month history of progressive opsoclonus and ataxia. He had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA load and CD4+ of ...   \n",
       "2  Most myeloid lineage cells express the receptor and coreceptors that make them susceptible to infection by primate lentiviruses (SIVs and HIVs). However, macrophages are the only myeloid lineage cell commonly infected by SIVs and/or HIVs. The frequency of infected macrophages varies greatly across specific host and virus combinations as well as disease states, with infection rates being greatest in pathogenic SIV infections of non-natural hosts (i.e., Asian nonhuman primates (Asian NHPs)) and late in untreated HIV-1 infection. In contrast, macrophages from natural SIV hosts (i.e., African ...   \n",
       "3  HIV-1 cell entry is mediated by binding to the CD4-receptor and chemokine co-receptors CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4). R5-tropic viruses are predominantly detected during early infection. A switch to X4-tropism often occurs during the course of infection. X4-tropism switching is strongly associated with accelerated disease progression and jeopardizes CCR5-based HIV-1 cure strategies. It is unclear whether host immunological factors play a causative role in tropism switching. We investigated the relationship between immunological factors and X4-tropism in a cross-sectional study in HIV-1 subtype C...   \n",

While previous studies have analyzed cross-level CRF01_AE viral genomic data in populations, less is known about intrapatient viral evolutionary dynamics during antiviral treatment (ART) failure. Methods We longitudinally sampled plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at different time points from one HIV-1 infected patient. The evolution of viral quasispecies was inferred from viral phylogenies. Results Prior to treatment, no drug resistant mutations were found in this patient's plasma, and all viruses had CCR5 tropism. Two months after treatment, the majority of the virus population in plasma and PBMC were drug resistant and X4-tropic. By five months after treatment, the viral load increased significantly, and viruses reversed tropism from X4 to R5 in plasma and PBMC. During treatment failure, the effective population of the pol DNA reservoir in PBMC remained stable, while the env DNA reservoir increased. The effective population of the R5 tropism virus increased more rapidly than that of the X4 tropism virus. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions in the env gene of R5 tropism virus (0.43) was lower than X4 tropism (0.52). However, four env positive selection sites were identified in R5 tropism viruses (HXB2: 364, 398, 399 and 400) but none were identified in X4 tropism viruses. Conclusions Our data demonstrated the different intrapatient evolutionary dynamics patterns of env and pol genes in an individual who experienced periods of ART failure. Our findings also suggest the importance of the R5 tropism virus in the DNA reservoir during ART failure.\",\"Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA) syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary conjugate saccadic eye movements, myoclonus, and ataxia. Few reports exist on patients with HIV and OMA. A 41-year-old man diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 1997 coursed with multiple anti-retroviral schemes as a consequence of poor adherence. In 2008 he presented an HIV-1 viral load of 100,000 copies/mL and a CD4+ T cell count of 10 cells/mm3. In 2013 our patient arrived with an 11-month history of progressive opsoclonus and ataxia. He had undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA load and CD4+ of 606 cells/mm3. No opportunistic infections were found. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mildly elevated protein concentration and HIV-1 viral load of 534 copies/mL. Cerebrospinal fluid co-receptor tropism test showed selective CCR5 usage. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hippocampal atrophy and T2-weighted hyperintensities. Our patient exhibited a dramatic recovery and cerebrospinal fluid HIV clearance after adjustment of anti-retroviral treatment based on genotyping resistance and tropism analyses. In patients with HIV presenting cengral nervous system dysfunction without opportunistic infections, cerebro-spinal fluid and plasma HIV-1 viral load, resistance and tropism tests should be performed to assess a potential viral escape and to design the appropriate anti-retroviral therapy in an individual patient basis.\",\"Most myeloid lineage cells express the receptor and coreceptors that make them susceptible to infection by primate lentiviruses (SIVs and HIVs). However, macrophages are the only myeloid lineage cell commonly infected by SIVs and/or HIVs. The frequency of infected macrophages varies greatly across specific host and virus combinations as well as disease states, with infection rates being greatest in pathogenic SIV infections of non-natural hosts (i.e., Asian nonhuman primates (Asian NHPs)) and late in untreated HIV-1 infection. In contrast, macrophages from natural SIV hosts (i.e., African NHPs) are largely resistant to infection due to entry and/or post-entry restriction mechanisms. These highly variable rates of macrophage infection may stem from differences in the host immune environment, entry and post-entry restriction mechanisms, the ability of a virus to adapt to efficiently infect macrophages, and the pleiotropic effects of macrophage-tropism including the ability to infect cells lacking CD4 and increased neutralization sensitivity. Questions remain about the relationship between rates of macrophage infection and viral pathogenesis, with some evidence suggesting that elevated levels of macrophage infection may contribute to greater pathogenesis in non-natural SIV hosts. Alternatively, extensive infection of macrophages may only emerge in the context of high viral loads and immunodeficiency, making it a symptom of highly pathogenic infections, not a primary driver of pathogenesis.\",\"HIV-1 cell entry is mediated by binding to the CD4-receptor and chemokine co-receptors CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4). R5-tropic viruses are predominantly detected during early infection. A switch to X4-tropism often occurs during the course of infection. X4-tropism switching is strongly associated with accelerated disease progression and jeopardizes CCR5-based HIV-1 cure strategies. It is unclear whether host immunological factors play a causative role in tropism switching. We investigated the relationship between immunological factors and X4-tropism in a cross-sectional study in HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C)-infected patients and in a longitudinal HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) seroconverter cohort. Principal component analysis identified a cluster of immunological markers (%HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, %CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, %CD38<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, %CD70<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, %CD169<sup>+</sup> monocytes, and absolute CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count) in HIV-1C patients that was independently associated with X4-tropism (aOR 1.044, 95% CI 1.003-1.087, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0392). Analysis of individual cluster contributors revealed strong correlations of two markers of T-cell activation (%HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, %HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells) with X4-tropism, both in HIV-1C patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01;p\\u2009=\\u20090.03) and HIV-1B patients (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0003;p\\u2009=\\u20090.0001). Follow-up data from HIV-1B patients subsequently revealed that T-cell activation precedes and independently predicts X4-tropism switching (aHR 1.186, 95% CI 1.065-1.321, p\\u2009=\\u20090.002), providing novel insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis and CCR5-based curative strategies.\",\"Sub-Saharan African countries are transitioning to dolutegravir-based regimens, even for patients with extensive previous drug exposure, including first-generation integrase strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTI) such as raltegravir. Such exposure might have implications on cross-resistance to dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapies (ART). We report a 65\\u2009years old Cameroonian, previously exposed to raltegravir, and failing on third-line treatment with multi-drug resistance to darunavir/r and dolutegravir. Genotypic resistance testing (GRT) and viral tropism were performed during monitoring time points. The patient initiated ART in August 2007. At the time point of the first (29.04.2010), second (01.12.2017) and third (08.08.2019) GRT, prior ART exposure included 3TC, d4T, NVP and EFV; additionally TDF, DRV/r and RAL; and additionally ABC and DTG respectively. First GRT revealed mutations associated with resistance only to first-generation Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Second GRT revealed mutations associated with high-level resistance to all NRTIs, first generation NNRTIs, all ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), and all INSTI, while viral tropism (using geno2pheno) revealed a CCR5-tropic virus with a false positive rate (FPR) of 60.9% suggesting effectiveness of maraviroc (MRV). The third GRT showed high-level resistance to NRTI, NNRTI, all PI and all INSTI, with additional mutations (H221HY for NNRTI and S147G for INSTI), and a CCR5-tropic virus with a slightly reduced FPR (57.0%). Without any locally available active therapeutic option, the patient has been on a maintenance therapy with \\\"DRV/r (600mg x 2/day)+TDF+3TC\\\" and patient/family-centered adherence has been reinforced. Since the first viral load (VL) measurement in 2010, the patient has had 12 VL tests with the VL ranging from 4.97 Log to 6.44 Log copies/mL and the CD4 count never exceeded 200 cells/\\u03bcL. As African countries transition to dolutegravir-based regimens, prior raltegravir-exposure may prompt selection (and potential transmission) of dolutegravir-resistance, supporting case surveillance.\",\"HIV-1 infects a wide range of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with different phenotypic properties and differing expression levels of entry coreceptors. We sought to determine the viral tropism of subtype C (C-HIV) Envelope (Env) clones for different CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets and whether tropism changes during acute to chronic disease progression. HIV-1 envs were amplified from the plasma of five C-HIV infected women from three untreated time points; less than 2\\u00a0months, 1-year and 3-years post-infection. Pseudoviruses were generated from Env clones, phenotyped for coreceptor usage and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset tropism was measured by flow cytometry. A total of 50 C-HIV envs were cloned and screened for functionality in pseudovirus infection assays. Phylogenetic and variable region characteristic analysis demonstrated evolution in envs between time points. We found 45 pseudoviruses were functional and all used CCR5 to mediate entry into NP2/CD4/CCR5 cells. In vitro infection assays showed transitional memory (TM) and effector memory (EM) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were more frequently infected (median: 46% and 25% of total infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells respectively) than na\\u00efve, stem cell memory, central memory and terminally differentiated cells. This was not due to these subsets contributing a higher proportion of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell pool, rather these subsets were more susceptible to infection (median: 5.38% EM and 2.15% TM cells infected), consistent with heightened CCR5 expression on EM and TM cells. No inter- or intra-participant changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset tropism were observed across the three-time points. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets that express more CCR5 were more susceptible to infection with C-HIV Envs, suggesting that these may be the major cellular targets during the first 3\\u00a0years of infection. Moreover, we found that viral tropism for different CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in vitro did not change between Envs cloned from acute to chronic disease stages. Finally, central memory, na\\u00efve and stem cell memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets were susceptible to infection, albeit inefficiently by Envs from all time-points, suggesting that direct infection of these cells may help establish the latent reservoir early in infection.\",\"Lentiviral vectors (LVs) have provided an efficient way to integrate our gene of interest into eukaryote cells. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived LVs have been vastly studied to become an invaluable asset in gene delivery. This abled LVs to be used in both research laboratories and gene therapy. Pseudotyping HIV-1 based LVs, abled it to transduce different types of cells, especially hematopoietic stem cells. A wide range of tropism, plus to the ability to integrate genes into target cells, made LVs an armamentarium in gene therapy. The third and fourth generations of self-inactivating LVs are being used to achieve safe gene therapy. Not only advanced methods enabled the clinical-grade LV production on a large scale, but also considerably heightened transduction efficiency. One of which is microfluidic systems that revolutionized gene delivery approaches. Since gene therapy using LVs attracted lots of attention to itself, we provided a brief review of LV structure and life-cycle along with methods for improving both LV production and transduction. Also, we mentioned some of their utilization in immunotherapy and gene therapy.\",\"The human-specific tropism of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) has complicated the development of a macaque model of HIV-1 infection/AIDS that is suitable for preclinical evaluation of vaccines and novel treatment strategies. Several innate retroviral restriction factors, such as APOBEC3 family of proteins, TRIM5\\u03b1, BST2, and SAMHD1, that prevent HIV-1 replication have been identified in macaque cells. Accessory proteins expressed by Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV) such as viral infectivity factor (Vif), viral protein X (Vpx), viral protein R (Vpr), and negative factor (Nef) have been shown to play key roles in overcoming these restriction factors in macaque cells. Thus, substituting HIV-1 accessory genes with those from SIV may enable HIV-1 replication in macaques. We and others have constructed macaque-tropic HIV-1 derivatives [also called simian-tropic HIV-1 (stHIV-1) or Human-Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (HSIV)] carrying SIV <i>vif</i> to overcome APOBEC3 family proteins. Additional modifications to HIV-1 <i>gag</i> in some of the macaque-tropic HIV-1 have also been done to overcome TRIM5\\u03b1 restriction in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Although these viruses replicate persistently in macaque species, they do not result in CD4 depletion. Thus, these studies suggest that additional blocks to HIV-1 replication exist in macaques that prevent high-level viral replication. Furthermore, serial animal-to-animal passaging of macaque-tropic HIV-1 <i>in vivo</i> has not resulted in pathogenic variants that cause AIDS in immunocompetent macaques. In this review, we discuss recent developments made toward developing macaque model of HIV-1 infection.\",\"Sub-Saharan region in Africa still holds the highest burden of HIV/AIDS globally. HIV-1 requires coreceptor to gain entry into permissive cells to initiate infection. Molecular analysis of the chemokine coreceptor usage is important clinically and in the effective management of AIDS virus. This study aims to determine the coreceptor usage among HIV-1 drug-naive patients residing in the rural Eastern cape, South Africa. We collected blood samples from 55 HIV-infected patients into an anticoagulant vacutainer. RNA was extracted from separated plasma, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed followed by nested polymerase chain reaction to amplify the partial envelope fragment spanning the C2-C3 region. Sanger sequencing was done on the amplicons using the BigDye Terminator V3.1 sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) while sequences were manually edited using BioEdit and Geneious 10.2.6 tools. The WebPSSM and Geno2pheno online tools were also utilized to predict coreceptor tropism while the phylogenetic analysis of the isolates was determined using MEGA 7. Of the 55 blood samples collected for the study, 50 (91%) were successfully amplified and sequenced. The mean age of the patients was 32 (18-56) years while the ratio of men to women was 35% and 65% correspondingly. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 50 sequences clustered with HIV-1 subtype C reference strains. Viral tropism of the V3 loop revealed 47 sequences to be R5 strains, while three sequences (T1E, T10E, and T11E,) were classified as X4 strains based on the WebPSSM and the Geno2pheno algorithm. HIV-1 R5 tropic strains were the most dominant virus obtained from this study, while HIV-1 subtype C still drives the epidemic in South Africa suggesting greater <i>in vivo</i> and host pathogen fitness. Documented data on mapping out cellular tropism based on viral tropism are important as maraviroc and the other CCR5 antagonist could be introduced as part of the treatment regimen in South Africa.\",\"Oregano essential oil has long been known for its health-promoting benefits. Here, we report its activity against viral replication. Oregano oil was found to specifically inhibit lentiviruses, such as human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), irrespective of virus tropism, but not hepatitis C virus, adenovirus 5 (ADV5), Zika virus, and influenza (H1N1) virus. Oregano oil's most abundant components, carvacrol and its isomer, thymol, were shown to block virus-target cell fusion while not perturbing other stages of the virus life cycle. We detected changes in virus particle density, suggesting that cholesterol depletion from the HIV-1 envelope membrane reduces virus entry. Furthermore, infection was rescued by adding exogenous cholesterol. The evolution of viral resistance to carvacrol supported this mechanism of action with the identification of mutations in the viral gp41 fusion protein that counteracted cholesterol depletion. In addition, resistance to carvacrol emerged later than typically observed for other clinically used drugs, strengthening its antiviral potential. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed key motifs of carvacrol and thymol required for HIV neutralization and identified previously unknown active analogs. Carvacrol was also shown to additively cooperate with antiretroviral therapy. In sum, oregano oil and improved carvacrol and thymol analogs could be considered to supplement current HIV therapeutics.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Oregano essential oil has multiple benefits in traditional medicine, cosmetics, and food industries. Carvacrol and its analog, thymol, are well-described components of oregano oil. Here, we show that these compounds inhibit HIV-target cell fusion independently of viral tropism. Our results suggest that carvacrol and thymol alter the cholesterol content of the viral membrane, blocking HIV-1 entry into the target cell. Resistance to carvacrol has selected for viruses with mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp41. This protein is known for its interaction with cholesterol present in membrane lipid rafts. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of therapies targeting the viral envelope membrane, and oregano oil is a safe supplement to antiretrovirals, potentially delaying disease progression and resistance development.\",\"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most lethal type of brain tumor that is not yet curable owing to its frequent resurgence after surgery. Resistance is mainly caused by the presence of a subpopulation of tumor cells, the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. In 2015, Zikavirus (ZIKV)-induced microcephaly emerged in newborns, indicating that ZIKV has a specific neurotropism. Accordingly, an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs was demonstrated in a murine tumor model. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is enveloped by two proteins, <i>pr</i>M and E. The pME expression plasmid along with the HIV-1 vector pNL Luc AM generated <i>pr</i>ME pseudotyped viral particles. Four different <i>pr</i>ME envelopes, Z1 to Z4, were cloned, and the corresponding pseudotypes, Z1- to Z4-HIV<i>luc</i>, produced by this two-plasmid system, were tested for entry efficiency using Vero-B4 cells. The most efficient pseudotype, Z1-HIV<i>luc</i>, also infected glioma-derived cell lines U87 and 86HG39. The pseudotype system was then extended by using a three-plasmid system including pME-Z1, the HIV-1 packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the lentiviral vector pLenti-luciferase-P2A-Neo. The corresponding pseudotype, designated Z1-LENTI<i>luc</i>, also infected U87 and 86HG39 cells. Altogether, a pseudotyped virus especially targeting glioma-derived cells might be a promising candidate for a prospective glioblastoma-directed virotherapy.\",\"Latent HIV-1 is a major hurdle in obtaining HIV-1 sustained virological remission (SVR). Here we explored histone deacetylation inhibition property of nicotinamide (NAM; n=17) for the first time in comparison to a combination of methyltransferase inhibitors (MTIs; Chaetocin and BIX01294; n=25) to reactivate latent HIV ex vivo in CD8-depleted PBMCs from antiretroviral treated aviremic individuals. NAM reactivated HIV-1 from 13/17 (76.4%) samples compared to 20/25 (80.0%) using MTIs with mean viral load (VLs) of 4.32 and 3.22 log<sub>10</sub> RNA copies/mL, respectively (p=0.004). Mean purging time after NAM and MTIs stimulation was 5.1 and 6.75 days, respectively (p=0.73). Viral purging in autologous cultures exhibited blunted HIV recovery with fluctuating VLs followed by a complete viral extinction when expanded in allogenic system. Electron microscopy from five supernatants revealed anomalous viral particles, with lack of complete viral genomes when characterized by ultradeep sequencing through metagenomics approach (n=4). NAM alone was more potent HIV-1 activator than combination of MTIs, with potential of clinical use.\",\"The second human pegivirus HPgV-2 is a novel blood-borne virus that is strongly associated with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, the molecular evidence for their association as well as the natural history and tissue tropism of HPgV-2 remain to be elucidated. In this longitudinal study, a total of 753 patients including 512 HIV-1 and HCV co-infected patients were enrolled to characterize the natural history of HPgV-2 infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and liver biopsies were collected to determine the tissue tropism of HPgV-2 using immunohistochemical staining of the HPgV-2 antigen and in situ hybridization of HPgV-2 RNA. We documented both persistent HPgV-2 infection with the presence of HPgV-2 viral RNA and antibodies up to 4.6 years and resolved HPgV-2 infection, accompanied by a simultaneous decline of anti-HPgV-2 antibodies and clearance of HPgV-2 viremia. Furthermore, we observed the clearance of HCV, but not HPgV-2, by treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Biochemical tests and pathological analyses did not reveal any indication of hepatic impairment caused by HPgV-2. HPgV-2 RNA and nonstructural antigen were detected in the lymphocytes, but not in the hepatocytes present in the liver biopsy samples. In addition, both positive- and negative-strand HPgV-2 RNAs were detected in PBMCs, especially in B cells. The present study is the first to provide evidence that HPgV-2 is a lymphotropic, but not a hepatotropic virus and that HPgV-2 replication is independent of HCV viremia. These new findings let us gain insights into the evolution and persistent infection of RNA viruses in humans.\",\"Maraviroc, a C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist, has been used as an alternative antiretroviral drug in treatment-experienced adults and children infected by CCR5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. Prior to widespread use of this drug, rates of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism and factors associated with coreceptor tropism had to be determined. HIV-1-infected individuals aged\\u2005<20 years with HIV-1 viral loads\\u2005>1000 RNA copies/mL who were treatment-experienced or treatment-naive were enrolled. HIV-1 coreceptor tropism was determined using a genotypic test in which V3 sequences were analyzed with GENO2PHENO version 2.5 and a false discovery rate of 5%. Fifty-two HIV-1-infected patients were recruited. The median age of participants was 14.9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 8.9-16.8 years). The median CD4 cell count was 396.0 cells/\\u00b5L (IQR, 72.0-630.3 cells/\\u00b5L). The median HIV-1 viral load was 43 339 RNA copies/mL (IQR, 8874-197 055 copies/mL). Thirty-nine patients (75%) were treatment-experienced. The most prevalent HIV-1 subtype in this population was CRF01_AE (36 patients, 69.2%). Based on analyses of V3 loop sequences, 5 of 13 treatment-naive patients (38.5%) and 11 of 39 treatment-experienced patients (28.2%) were infected by R5 viruses, while 7 of 13 treatment-naive patients (53.8%) and 19 of 39 treatment-experienced patients (48.7%) were infected by X4 viruses. The only factor associated with the presence of X4 viruses was HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE. X4-tropic viruses are associated with the CRF01_AE subtype. Hence, testing of HIV tropism should be performed before treatment with CCR5 inhibitors in children in areas where CRF01_AE predominates.\",\"A robust simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-macaque model of latency is critical to investigate eradicative and suppressive strategies that target HIV-1 Env. To this end, we previously reported a novel strategy for constructing SHIVs that bear primary or transmitted/founder (TF) Envs with modifications at Env residue 375 that enable efficient replication in Indian rhesus macaques (RM). Such TF SHIVs, however, have not been examined for their suitability for HIV-1 latency and cure research. Here, we evaluate two promising TF SHIVs, SHIV.D.191859 and SHIV.C.CH848, which encode TF subtype D and C HIV-1 Envs, respectively, for their viral kinetics and persistence during suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and treatment interruption in RM. Our results suggest that the viral kinetics of these SHIVs in RM during acute, early, and chronic infection, and upon cART initiation, maintenance and discontinuation, mirror those of HIV-1 infection. We demonstrate consistent early peak and set point viremia, rapid declines in viremia to undetectable plasma titers following cART initiation, infection of long-lived cellular subsets and establishment of viral latency, and viral rebound with return to pretreatment set point viremia following treatment interruption. The viral dynamics and reservoir biology of SHIV.D.191859, and to a lesser extent SHIV.C.CH848, during chronic infection, cART administration, and upon treatment interruption suggest that these TF SHIVs are promising reagents for a SHIV model of HIV-1 latency and cure.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) have been successfully used for over 2 decades to study virus-host interactions, transmission, and pathogenesis in rhesus macaques. The majority of Env trimers of most previously studied SHIVs, however, do not recapitulate key properties of transmitted/founder (TF) or primary HIV-1 isolates, such as CCR5 tropism, tier 2 neutralization resistance, and native trimer conformation. Here, we test two recently generated TF SHIVs, SHIV.D.191859 and SHIV.C.CH848, which were designed to address these issues as components of a nonhuman primate model of HIV-1 latency. We conclude that the TF SHIV-macaque model reflects several hallmarks of HIV and SIV infection and latency. Results suggest that this model has broad applications for evaluating eradicative and suppressive strategies against the HIV reservoir, including Env-specific interventions, therapeutic vaccines, and engineered T cells.\",\"HIV can persist in people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, including naive cells, central memory (CM) cells, transitional (TM) cells, and effector memory (EM) cells. Since these cells express different levels of the viral coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 on their surface, we sought to determine whether the HIV envelope protein (Env) was genotypically and phenotypically different between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets isolated from PLWH on suppressive ART (<i>n</i>\\u2009=\\u20098). Single genome amplification for the HIV <i>env</i> gene was performed on genomic DNA extracts from different CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. We detected CXCR4-using (X4) strains in five of the eight participants studied, and in these participants, the prevalence of X4 strains was higher in naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells than in the memory subsets. Conversely, R5 strains were mostly found in the TM and EM populations. Identical sets of <i>env</i> sequences, consistent with clonal expansion of some infected cells, were more frequent in EM cells. These expanded identical sequences could also be detected in multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, suggesting that infected cells can undergo T cell differentiation. These identical sequences largely encoded intact and functional Env proteins. Our results are consistent with a model in which X4 HIV strains infect and potentially establish latency in naive and CM CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through direct infection, in addition to maintenance of the reservoir through differentiation and proliferation of infected cells.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In people living with HIV (PLWH) on suppressive ART, latent HIV can be found in a diverse range of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including quiescent naive and central memory cells that are typically difficult to infect <i>in vitro</i> It is currently unclear how latency is established in these cells <i>in vivo</i> We show that in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from PLWH on suppressive ART, the use of the coreceptor CXCR4 was prevalent among viruses amplified from naive and central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, we found that expanded numbers of identical viral sequences were most common in the effector memory population, and these identical sequences were also found in multiple different CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. Our results help to shed light on how a range of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets come to harbor HIV DNA, which is one of the major barriers to eradicating the virus from PLWH.\",\"Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages as well as osteoclasts (OCs) are emerging as target cells of HIV-1 involved in virus transmission, dissemination, and establishment of persistent tissue virus reservoirs. While these myeloid cells are poorly infected by cell-free viruses because of the high expression levels of cellular restriction factors such as SAMHD1, we show here that HIV-1 uses a specific and common cell-to-cell fusion mechanism for virus transfer and dissemination from infected T lymphocytes to the target cells of the myeloid lineage, including immature DCs (iDCs), OCs, and macrophages, but not monocytes and mature DCs. The establishment of contacts with infected T cells leads to heterotypic cell fusion for the fast and massive transfer of viral material into OC and iDC targets, which subsequently triggers homotypic fusion with noninfected neighboring OCs and iDCs for virus dissemination. These two cell-to-cell fusion processes are not restricted by SAMHD1 and allow very efficient spreading of virus in myeloid cells, resulting in the formation of highly virus-productive multinucleated giant cells. These results reveal the cellular mechanism for SAMHD1-independent cell-to-cell spreading of HIV-1 in myeloid cell targets through the formation of the infected multinucleated giant cells observed <i>in vivo</i> in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of HIV-1-infected patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> We demonstrate that HIV-1 uses a common two-step cell-to-cell fusion mechanism for massive virus transfer from infected T lymphocytes and dissemination to myeloid target cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages as well as osteoclasts. This cell-to-cell infection process bypasses the restriction imposed by the SAMHD1 host cell restriction factor for HIV-1 replication, leading to the formation of highly virus-productive multinucleated giant cells as observed <i>in vivo</i> in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues of HIV-1-infected patients. Since myeloid cells are emerging as important target cells of HIV-1, these results contribute to a better understanding of the role of these myeloid cells in pathogenesis, including cell-associated virus sexual transmission, cell-to-cell virus spreading, and establishment of long-lived viral tissue reservoirs.\",\"HIV infection causes CD4 depletion and immune deficiency. The virus infects CD4 T cells through binding to CD4 and one of the chemokine coreceptors, CXCR4 (X4) or CCR5 (R5). It has also been known that HIV tropism switch, from R5 to X4, is associated with rapid CD4 depletion, suggesting a key role of viral factors in driving CD4 depletion. However, the virological driver for HIV-mediated CD4 depletion has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that HIV-mediated chemokine coreceptor signaling, particularly chronic signaling through CXCR4, plays a major role in CD4 dysfunction and depletion; we also hypothesized that there is an R5X4 signaling (R5X4sig) viral subspecies, evolving from the natural replication course of R5-utilizing viruses, that is responsible for CD4 T cell depletion in R5 virus infection. To gain traction for our hypothesis, in this review, we discuss a recent finding from Cui and co-authors who described the rapid tropism switch and high pathogenicity of an HIV-1 R5 virus, CRF01_AE. We speculate that CRF01_AE may be the hypothetical R5X4sig viral species that is rapidly evolving towards the X4 phenotype. We also attempt to discuss the intricate relationships between HIV-mediated chemokine coreceptor signaling, viral tropism switch and HIV-mediated CD4 depletion, in hopes of providing a deeper understanding of HIV pathogenesis in blood CD4 T cells.\",\"Follicular helper T (TFH) cells have been shown to support productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication and to serve as a key component of the latent viral reservoir. However, the viral characteristics of this latent reservoir and the clinical relevance of this reservoir remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the tropic composition of latent viruses from peripheral TFH (pTFH), non-TFH memory, and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from individuals with HIV-1 infections on suppressive combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). X4-tropic latent HIV-1 was preferentially enriched in pTFH cells compared to levels in the other two subsets. Interestingly, the ratio of X4-tropic latent HIV-1 in pTFH cells not only was robustly and inversely correlated with blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts across patients but also was prognostic of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recovery in individuals on long-term cART. Moreover, patients with higher X4-tropic latent HIV-1 ratios in pTFH cells showed greater risks of opportunistic coinfections. These findings reveal the characteristics of latent HIV-1 in TFH cells and suggest that the ratio of X4-tropic latent HIV-1 in pTFH cells is a valuable indicator for disease progression and cART efficacy.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> TFH cells have been shown to harbor a significant amount of latent HIV-1; however, the viral characteristics of this reservoir and its clinical relevance remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that X4-tropic latent HIV-1 is preferentially enriched in pTFH cells, which also accurately reflects the viral tropism shift. The ratio of X4-tropic proviruses in pTFH cells but not in other memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets is inversely and closely correlated with blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recovery rates with cART. Our data suggest that the ratio of X4-tropic provirus in peripheral TFH cells can be easily measured and reflects disease progression and treatment outcomes during cART.\",\"Numerous challenges have impeded HIV-1 vaccine development. Among these is the lack of a convenient small animal model in which to study antibody elicitation and efficacy. We describe a chimeric Rhabdo-Immunodeficiency virus (RhIV) murine model that recapitulates key features of HIV-1 entry, tropism and antibody sensitivity. RhIVs are based on vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV), but viral entry is mediated by HIV-1 Env proteins from diverse HIV-1 strains. RhIV infection of transgenic mice expressing human CD4 and CCR5, exclusively on mouse CD4+ cells, at levels mimicking those on human CD4+ T-cells, resulted in acute, resolving viremia and CD4+ T-cell depletion. RhIV infection elicited protective immunity, and antibodies to HIV-1 Env that were primarily non-neutralizing and had modest protective efficacy following passive transfer. The RhIV model enables the convenient in vivo study of HIV-1 Env-receptor interactions, antiviral activity of antibodies and humoral responses against HIV-1 Env, in a genetically manipulatable host.\",\"Follicular helper T cells (Tfh), CD4 lymphocytes critical for efficient antibody responses, have been shown to be key human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reservoirs. Human immunodeficiency virus-2 infection represents a unique naturally occurring model for investigating Tfh role in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, given its slow rate of CD4 decline, low to undetectable viremia, and high neutralizing antibody titers throughout the disease course. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, Tfh susceptibility to HIV-2 infection by combining in vitro infection of tonsillar Tfh with the ex vivo study of circulating Tfh from HIV-2-infected patients. We reveal that Tfh support productive HIV-2 infection and are preferential viral targets in HIV-2-infected individuals.\",\"Currently, HIV-1 CRF63_02A6 is the prevalent genetic variant of the HIV-infected subjects in the major part of the Siberian Federal District (Russia). The HIV-1 CRF63_02A6 R5-tropic pT11.17 and X4-tropic pMtBs.18 infectious molecular clones (IMCs) were constructed using the virus isolates recovered in 2015 and 2017 of male HIV-infected Russian residents (from Tomsk and Novosibirsk, respectively). Near full-length proviral HIV-1 sequences (9,644 and 9,748\\u2009bp) were subcloned in pBluescript II KS(-). The CRF63_02A6 IMC virions were obtained by transfecting HEK293T cells with the constructed plasmids and demonstrated a stable growth in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture (p24 concentration increased >1,000-fold and the virus protein accumulation in culture liquid exceeded 100,000\\u2009pg/mL). The tropism of CRF63_02A6 IMCs was determined genotypically (using Geno2pheno) and phenotypically by cultivating the IMC virions in MT-2, U87-CD4-CCR5, and U87-CD4-CXCR4 cell cultures. The obtained HIV-1 CRF63_02A6 IMCs may be useful in basic and applied research.\",\"Current antiretroviral therapy allows the control of HIV replication but a relapse occurs most of the time in case of treatment interruption. The viral genome integration explains this persistence of HIV in all body tissues, at very variable levels depending on their density of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, HIV main target. Secondary lymphoid tissues are the most infected organs. Several techniques can be used to characterize the reservoir, detecting different forms of the virus. They are complementary to decipher the establishment of HIV reservoir during the primary infection and its dynamics afterwards. In peripheral blood, the earlier the initiation of treatment, the more important is the decrease in total HIV DNA. Early treatment prevents the progressive increase in stable integrated forms of HIV DNA and preserves immune cells from infection. A better understanding of HIV infection in controllers will also aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting the reservoir.\",\"Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV), formerly known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) Indiana (VSV<sub>IND</sub>), is a model virus that is exceptionally sensitive to the inhibitory action of interferons (IFNs). Interferons induce an antiviral state by stimulating the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs can constrain viral replication, limit tissue tropism, reduce pathogenicity, and inhibit viral transmission. Since VSIV is used as a backbone for multiple oncolytic and vaccine strategies, understanding how ISGs restrict VSIV not only helps in understanding VSIV-induced pathogenesis but also helps us evaluate and understand the safety and efficacy of VSIV-based therapies. Thus, there is a need to identify and characterize the ISGs that possess anti-VSIV activity. Using arrayed ISG expression screening, we identified TRIM69 as an ISG that potently inhibits VSIV. This inhibition was highly specific as multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, HIV-1, Rift Valley fever virus, and dengue virus, were unaffected by TRIM69. Indeed, just one amino acid substitution in VSIV can govern sensitivity/resistance to TRIM69. Furthermore, TRIM69 is highly divergent in human populations and exhibits signatures of positive selection that are consistent with this gene playing a key role in antiviral immunity. We propose that TRIM69 is an IFN-induced inhibitor of VSIV and speculate that TRIM69 could be important in limiting VSIV pathogenesis and might influence the specificity and/or efficacy of vesiculovirus-based therapies.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) is a veterinary pathogen that is also used as a backbone for many oncolytic and vaccine strategies. In natural and therapeutic settings, viral infections like VSIV are sensed by the host, and as a result the host cells make proteins that can protect them from viruses. In the case of VSIV, these antiviral proteins constrain viral replication and protect most healthy tissues from virus infection. In order to understand how VSIV causes disease and how healthy tissues are protected from VSIV-based therapies, it is crucial that we identify the proteins that inhibit VSIV. Here, we show that TRIM69 is an antiviral defense that can potently and specifically block VSIV infection.\",\"To study the long-term evolution of the transmitted CXCR4-using viruses. CCR5-using viruses (R5 viruses) predominate during primary HIV-1 infections (PHI) while CXCR4-using viruses are isolated in less than 10% of PHI. Six patients infected with an R5X4 virus, detected by a sensitive phenotypic assay during PHI, were matched with six patients infected with a pure R5 virus for sex, Fiebig stage, time of antiretroviral initiation and duration of follow-up. We used MiSeq ultra-deep sequencing to determine the composition of the virus quasispecies during PHI and at the end of follow-up (median time of follow-up: 12.5 years). X4 viruses were detected by genetic analysis in three of six samples from the R5X4 group, accounting for 1.3-100% of the virus quasispecies, during PHI, and in four of six samples (accounting for 6.7-100%) at the end of follow-up. No X4 virus was detected in the R5 group during PHI and in only one patient (accounting for 1.2%) at the end of follow-up. The complexity of the virus quasispecies at the stage of PHI was higher in the R5X4 group than in the R5 group. Complexity increased from PHI to the end of follow-up in the R5 group but remained stable in the R5X4 group. CXCR4-using viruses persisted in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of several patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy for a median duration of 12.5 years after PHI. The genetic complexity of HIV-1 evolved differently post-PHI in patients infected with R5X4 viruses from those infected with R5 viruses.\",\"Resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are major reservoirs of latent HIV-1 infection, and may be formed during the early phase of the infection. Although CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 is highly transmissible during the early phase, newly infected individuals have usually been exposed to a mixture of R5 and CXCR4-tropic (X4) viruses, and X4 viral DNA is also detectable in the host. Our aim was to identify which subsets of resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to forming the latent reservoir in the presence of both X4 and R5 viruses. Primary resting CD4<sup>+</sup> na\\u00efve T (T<sub>N</sub>) cells, CCR5<sup>-</sup> memory T (T<sub>M</sub>) cells, and CCR5<sup>+</sup> T<sub>M</sub> cells isolated by flow cytometry were infected simultaneously with X4 and R5 HIV-1, which harbored different reporter genes, and were cultured in the resting condition. Flow cytometry at 3\\u00a0days post-infection demonstrated that X4 HIV-1<sup>+</sup> cells were present in all three subsets of cells, whereas R5 HIV-1<sup>+</sup> cells were present preferentially in CCR5<sup>+</sup> T<sub>M</sub> cells, but not in T<sub>N</sub> cells. Following CD3/CD28-mediated activation at 3\\u00a0days post-infection, numbers of R5 HIV-1<sup>+</sup> cells and X4 HIV-1<sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly only in the CCR5<sup>+</sup> T<sub>M</sub> subset, suggesting that it provides a major reservoir of replication-competent, latently infected viruses.\",\"HIV +Elite and Viremic controllers (EC/VCs) are able to control virus infection, perhaps because of host genetic determinants. We identified 16% (21 of 131) EC/VCs with CD4 +T cells with resistance specific to R5-tropic HIV, reversed after introduction of <i>ccr5</i>. R5 resistance was not observed in macrophages and depended upon the method of T cell activation. CD4 +T cells of these EC/VCs had lower <i>ccr2</i> and <i>ccr5</i> RNA levels, reduced CCR2 and CCR5 cell-surface expression, and decreased levels of secreted chemokines. T cells had no changes in chemokine receptor mRNA half-life but instead had lower levels of active transcription of <i>ccr2</i> and <i>ccr5</i>, despite having more accessible chromatin by ATAC-seq. Other nearby genes were also down-regulated, over a region of ~500 kb on chromosome 3p21. This same R5 resistance phenotype was observed in family members of an index VC, also associated with <i>ccr2</i>/<i>ccr5</i> down-regulation, suggesting that the phenotype is heritable.\",\"We previously developed CCR5-tropic neutralization-resistant simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) strains and a rhesus macaque model of infection with these SHIVs. We induced the production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against HIV-1 by infecting rhesus macaques with different neutralization-resistant SHIV strains. First, SHIV-MK1 (MK1) (neutralization susceptible, tier 1B) with CCR5 tropism was generated from SHIV-KS661 using CXCR4 as the main co-receptor. nAbs against parental-lineage and heterologous tier 2 viruses were induced by tier 1B virus (MK1) infection of the rhesus macaque MM482. We analyzed viral resistance to neutralization over time in MM482 and observed that the infecting virus mutated from tier 1B to tier 2 at 36 weeks postinfection (wpi). In addition, an analysis of mutations showed that N169D, K187E, S190N, S239, T459N (T459D at 91 wpi), and V842A mutations were present after 36 wpi. This led to the appearance of neutralization-resistant viral clones. In addition, MK1 was passaged in three rhesus macaques to generate neutralization-resistant SHIV-MK38 (MK38) (tier 2). We evaluated nAb production by rhesus macaques infected with SHIV-MK38 #818 (#818) (tier 2), a molecular clone of MK38. Neutralization of the parental lineage was induced earlier than in macaques infected with tier 1B virus, and neutralization activity against heterologous tier 2 virus was beginning to develop. Therefore, CCR5-tropic neutralization-resistant SHIV-infected rhesus macaques may be useful models of anti-HIV-1 nAb production and will facilitate the development of a vaccine that elicits nAbs against HIV-1.\",\"Integrase-strand-transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are known to rapidly reduce HIV-1 plasma viral load, replication cycles, and new viral integrations, thus potentially limiting viral evolution. Here, we assessed the role of INSTIs on HIV-1 V3 evolution in a cohort of 89 HIV-1-infected individuals starting an INSTI- (N\\u2009=\\u200941, [dolutegravir: N\\u2009=\\u20091; elvitegravir: N\\u2009=\\u20093; raltegravir: N\\u2009=\\u200937]) or a non-INSTI-based (N\\u2009=\\u200948) combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), with two plasma RNA V3 genotypic tests available (one before [baseline] and one during cART). V3 sequences were analysed for genetic distance (Tajima-Nei model) and positive selection (dN/dS ratio). Individuals were mainly infected by B subtype (71.9%). Median (interquartile-range, IQR) plasma viral load and CD4\\u2009+\\u2009T cell count at baseline were 4.8 (3.5-5.5) log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL and 207 (67-441) cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Genetic distance (median, IQR) between the V3 sequences obtained during cART and those obtained at baseline was 0.04 (0.01-0.07). By considering treatment, genetic distance was significantly lower in INSTI-treated than in non-INSTI-treated individuals (median [IQR]: 0.03[0.01-0.04] vs. 0.05[0.02-0.08], p\\u2009=\\u20090.026). In line with this, a positive selection (defined as dN/dS\\u2009\\u2265\\u20091) was observed in 36.6% of V3 sequences belonging to the INSTI-treated group and in 56.3% of non-INSTI group (p\\u2009=\\u20090.05). Multivariable logistic regression confirmed the independent correlation of INSTI-based regimens with a lower probability of both V3 evolution (adjusted odds-ratio: 0.35 [confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.88], p\\u2009=\\u20090.027) and positive selection (even if with a trend) (adjusted odds-ratio: 0.46 [CI 0.19-1.11], p\\u2009=\\u20090.083). Overall, this study suggests a role of INSTI-based regimen in limiting HIV-1 V3 evolution over time. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.\",\"Vicriviroc (VCV) is a CCR5 antagonist that blocks the viral entry of CCR5-tropic (R5) virions by binding to and inducing a conformational change in the chemokine receptor. Clinical resistance to CCR5 antagonists occurs in two phases, competitive and noncompetitive stages. In this study, we analyzed two subjects, from a phase 2b VCV clinical trial, whose quasispecies contained R5 and dual-mixed virions at the earliest recorded time of virological failure (VF). Genotypic analysis of R5-tropic patient-derived envelope genes revealed significant changes in the V1/V2 coding domain and convergence toward a more homogenous sequence under VCV therapy. Additionally, a small population of baseline clones sharing similar V1/V2 and V3 domains with the predominant VF isolate was observed. These clones were denoted preresistant based on their genotype. Preresistant clones and chimeric clones containing V1/V2 regions isolated during VF displayed high 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values relative to those at baseline, consistent with early competitive resistance. Genotypic analysis of the dual-tropic clones also showed significant changes in the V1/V2 region, different from the resistant R5-tropic viruses. Our findings suggest that the V1/V2 domain plays a key role in the initial step of development of drug resistance.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> It is believed that each CCR5 antagonist-resistant isolate will develop its own unique set of mutations, making it difficult to identify a signature mutation that can effectively predict CCR5 antagonist resistance. This may explain why we do not observe shared mutations among clinical studies. The present study examined the earliest events in the development of drug resistance with viral quasispecies that continued the use of CCR5 for entry. Genotypic and phenotypic assays demonstrated a distinct role of the variable domain V1/V2 in competitive resistance to CCR5 antagonist therapy. Thus, future studies analyzing the development of clinical resistance should focus on the relationship between the V1/V2 and V3 domains.\",\"The HIV-1 entry pathway into permissive cells has been a subject of debate. Accumulating evidence, including our previous single virus tracking results, suggests that HIV-1 can enter different cell types via endocytosis and CD4/coreceptor-dependent fusion with endosomes. However, recent studies that employed indirect techniques to infer the sites of HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T cells have concluded that endocytosis does not contribute to infection. To assess whether HIV-1 enters these cells via endocytosis, we probed the role of intracellular trafficking in HIV-1 entry/fusion by a targeted shRNA screen in a CD4+ T cell line. We performed a screen utilizing a direct virus-cell fusion assay as readout and identified several host proteins involved in endosomal trafficking/maturation, including Rab5A and sorting nexins, as factors regulating HIV-1 fusion and infection. Knockdown of these proteins inhibited HIV-1 fusion irrespective of coreceptor tropism, without altering the CD4 or coreceptor expression, or compromising the virus' ability to mediate fusion of two adjacent cells initiated by virus-plasma membrane fusion. Ectopic expression of Rab5A in non-permissive cells harboring Rab5A shRNAs partially restored the HIV-cell fusion. Together, these results implicate endocytic machinery in productive HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T cells.\",\"CCR5 plays immune functions and is the coreceptor for R5 HIV-1 strains. It exists in diverse conformations and oligomerization states. We interrogated the significance of the CCR5 structural diversity on HIV-1 infection. We show that envelope glycoproteins (gp120s) from different HIV-1 strains exhibit divergent binding levels to CCR5 on cell lines and primary cells, but not to CD4 or the CD4i monoclonal antibody E51. This owed to differential binding of the gp120s to different CCR5 populations, which exist in varying quantities at the cell surface and are differentially expressed between different cell types. Some, but not all, of these populations are antigenically distinct conformations of the coreceptor. The different binding levels of gp120s also correspond to differences in their capacity to bind CCR5 dimers/oligomers. Mutating the CCR5 dimerization interface changed conformation of the CCR5 homodimers and modulated differentially the binding of distinct gp120s. Env-pseudotyped viruses also use particular CCR5 conformations for entry, which may differ between different viruses and represent a subset of those binding gp120s. In particular, even if gp120s can bind both CCR5 monomers and oligomers, impairment of CCR5 oligomerization improved viral entry, suggesting that HIV-1 prefers monomers for entry. From a functional standpoint, we illustrate that the nature of the CCR5 molecules to which gp120/HIV-1 binds shapes sensitivity to inhibition by CCR5 ligands and cellular tropism. Differences exist in the CCR5 populations between T-cells and macrophages, and this is associated with differential capacity to bind gp120s and to support viral entry. In macrophages, CCR5 structural plasticity is critical for entry of blood-derived R5 isolates, which, in contrast to prototypical M-tropic strains from brain tissues, cannot benefit from enhanced affinity for CD4. Collectively, our results support a role for CCR5 heterogeneity in diversifying the phenotypic properties of HIV-1 isolates and provide new clues for development of CCR5-targeting drugs.\",\"Interferon (IFN) inhibits HIV replication by inducing antiviral effectors. To comprehensively identify IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, we assembled a CRISPR sgRNA library of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) into a modified lentiviral vector that allows for packaging of sgRNA-encoding genomes <i>in trans</i> into budding HIV-1 particles. We observed that knockout of Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) improved the performance of the screen due to ZAP-mediated inhibition of the vector. A small panel of IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin/BST2 and TRIM5alpha together explain the inhibitory effects of IFN on the CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strain, HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>, in THP-1 cells. A second screen with a CCR5-tropic primary strain, HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub>, described an overlapping, but non-identical, panel of restriction factors. Further, this screen also identifies HIV dependency factors. The ability of IFN-induced restriction factors to inhibit HIV strains to replicate in human cells suggests that these human restriction factors are incompletely antagonized. This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter).\",\"Elite and viremic HIV controllers are able to control their HIV infection and maintain undetectable or low-level viremia in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Despite extensive studies, the immune factors responsible for such exclusive control remain poorly defined. We identified a cohort of 14 HIV controllers that suffered an abrupt loss of HIV control (LoC) to investigate possible mechanisms and virological and immunological events related to the sudden loss of control. The in-depth analysis of these subjects involved the study of cell tropism of circulating virus, evidence for HIV superinfection, cellular immune responses to HIV, as well as an examination of viral adaptation to host immunity by Gag sequencing. Our data demonstrate that a poor capacity of T cells to mediate <i>in vitro</i> viral suppression, even in the context of protective HLA alleles, predicts a loss of viral control. In addition, the data suggest that inefficient viral control may be explained by an increase of CD8 T-cell activation and exhaustion before LoC. Furthermore, we detected a switch from C5- to X4-tropic viruses in 4 individuals after loss of control, suggesting that tropism shift might also contribute to disease progression in HIV controllers. The significantly reduced inhibition of <i>in vitro</i> viral replication and increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers preceding the abrupt loss of viral control may help identify untreated HIV controllers that are at risk of losing control and may offer a useful tool for monitoring individuals during treatment interruption phases in therapeutic vaccine trials.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> A few individuals can control HIV infection without the need for antiretroviral treatment and are referred to as HIV controllers. We have studied HIV controllers who suddenly lose this ability and present with high <i>in vivo</i> viral replication and decays in their CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts to identify potential immune and virological factors that were responsible for initial virus control. We identify <i>in vitro</i>-determined reductions in the ability of CD8 T cells to suppress viral control and the presence of PD-1-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with a naive immune phenotype as potential predictors of <i>in vivo</i> loss of virus control. The findings could be important for the clinical management of HIV controller individuals, and it may offer an important tool to anticipate viral rebound in individuals in clinical studies that include combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) treatment interruptions and which, if not treated quickly, could pose a significant risk to the trial participants.\",\"Macrophage (mac)-tropic human immnunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immnunodeficiency virus (SIV) in brain are associated with neurological disease. Mac-tropic HIV-1 evolves enhanced CD4 interactions that enable macrophage infection via CD4, which is in low abundance. In contrast, mac-tropic SIV is associated with CD4-independent infection via direct CCR5 binding. Recently, mac-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) from macaque brain was also reported to infect cells via CCR5 without CD4. Since SHIV envelope proteins (Envs) are derived from HIV-1, we tested more than 100 HIV-1 clade B Envs for infection of CD4-negative, CCR5<sup>+</sup> Cf2Th/CCR5 cells. However, no infection was detected. Our data suggest that there are differences in the evolution of mac-tropism in SIV and SHIV compared to HIV-1 clade B due to enhanced interactions with CCR5 and CD4, respectively.\",\"A major issue for present HIV-1 research is to establish model systems that reflect or mimic viral replication and pathogenesis actually observed in infected humans. To this end, various strategies using macaques as infection targets have long been pursued. In particular, experimental infections of rhesus macaques by HIV-1 derivatives have been believed to be best suited, if practicable, for studies on interaction of HIV-1 and humans under various circumstances. Recently, through <i>in vitro</i> genetic manipulations and viral cell-adaptations, we have successfully generated a series of HIV-1 derivatives with CXCR4-tropism or CCR5-tropism that grow in macaque cells to various degrees. Of these viruses, those with best replicative potentials can grow comparably with a pathogenic SIVmac in macaque cells by counteracting major restriction factors TRIM5, APOBEC3, and tetherin proteins. In this study, rhesus macaques were challenged with CXCR4-tropic (MN4/LSDQgtu) or CCR5-tropic (gtu + A4CI1) virus. The two viruses were found to productively infect rhesus macaques, being rhesus macaque-tropic HIV-1 (HIV-1rmt). However, plasma viral RNA was reduced to be an undetectable level in infected macaques at 5-6 weeks post-infection and thereafter. While replicated similarly well in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells, MN4/LSDQgtu grew much better than gtu + A4CI1 in the animals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that HIV-1 derivatives (variants) grow in rhesus macaques. These viruses certainly constitute firm bases for generating HIV-1rmt clones pathogenic for rhesus monkeys, albeit they grow more poorly than pathogenic SIVmac and SHIV clones reported to date.\",\"CRF01_AE is the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype among MSM in China. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanism of the accelerated CD4 T-cell decline in CRF01_AE-infected MSM remain incompletely understood. A long-term prospective follow-up study was conducted with 1388 MSM at risk of HIV-1 infection in Northeast China. MSM with primary HIV-1 CRF01_AE infection were identified and followed for 3-6 years to explore the determinants of rapid CD4 T-cell decline. Tropism was determined in primary infection by both single genome amplification-based genotypic prediction using four different algorithms and phenotypic determination using clinical isolates. Serial isolates were used to determine phenotype of coreceptor switch. Human leukocyte antigen genotypes and T-cell activation markers were determined. Fifty-nine MSM primarily infected with HIV-1 CRF01_AE were discovered and recruited for the follow-up study. CCR5-utilizing (R5) viruses accounted for up to 98% of HIV-1 CRF01_AE infections in Northeast China. Survival analysis indicated 39.5% of the patients underwent coreceptor switch within 3 years after infection. After adjustment for other potential risk factors, linear mixed-effect models demonstrated patients experienced R5 to CXCR4-utilizing/dual-tropic (X4/DM) coreceptor switch within 3 years after infection underwent a faster CD4 T-cell decline compared to those without coreceptor switch. Primary HIV-1 CRF01_AE infection among MSM in Northeast China is characterized by R5 viral infection and early R5 to X4/DM coreceptor switch, which is associated with rapid CD4 T-cell decline. The findings highlight the importance of immediate treatment among the CRF01_AE-infected MSM.\",\"Over half of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) suffer from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs), yet the molecular mechanisms leading to neuronal dysfunction are poorly understood. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) naturally infects cats and shares its structure, cell tropism, and pathology with HIV, including wide-ranging neurological deficits. We employ FIV as a model to elucidate the molecular pathways underlying HIV-induced neuronal dysfunction, in particular, synaptic alteration. Among HIV-induced neuron-damaging products, HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 triggers elevation of intracellular Ca2+ activity in neurons, stimulating various pathways to damage synaptic functions. We quantify neuronal Ca2+ activity using intracellular Ca2+ imaging in cultured hippocampal neurons and confirm that FIV envelope glycoprotein gp95 also elevates neuronal Ca2+ activity. In addition, we reveal that gp95 interacts with the chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and facilitates the release of intracellular Ca2+ by the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated Ca2+ channels, inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), and synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs), similar to HIV gp120. This suggests that HIV gp120 and FIV gp95 share a core pathological process in neurons. Significantly, gp95's stimulation of NMDARs activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) through the activation of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-cGMP pathway, which increases Ca2+ release from the ER and promotes surface expression of AMPA receptors, leading to an increase in synaptic activity. Moreover, we culture feline hippocampal neurons and confirm that gp95-induced neuronal Ca2+ overactivation is mediated by CXCR4 and cGKII. Finally, cGKII activation is also required for HIV gp120-induced Ca2+ hyperactivation. These results thus provide a novel neurobiological mechanism of cGKII-mediated synaptic hyperexcitation in HAND.\",\"The discovery of two main coreceptors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 has led to a better understanding of the interaction between HIV envelope and host cells, and development of new therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of CCR5 tropism among HIV-1-infected Koreans and identify the predictors for CCR5 tropism. We enrolled 250 HIV-1-infected subjects from four medical centers of three different cities in South Korea between April 2013 and May 2014. Genotypic assay for identifying coreceptor tropism of HIV-1 was performed with HIV RNA or HIV DNA. Nested polymerase chain reaction and population-based sequencing for the V3 region (HXB2 position 6225-7758) of the envelope were performed with HIV RNA or proviral DNA. Proviral DNA was used if the viral load of the subject was below 2000\\u2009copies/mL. Genotypic tropism was determined by a web-based bioinformatics tool (http://coreceptor.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). Among 250 individuals enrolled, only 143 subjects could be analyzed for genotypic tropism assay with HIV RNA or proviral DNA. The prevalence of CCR5 tropism was 69.2% (N\\u2009=\\u200999). We could not identify any significant clinical or epidemiological predictors for CCR5 tropism among enrolled subjects. The prevalence of CCR5 tropism in HIV-1-infected Korean individuals was 69.2%. Since we cannot predict coreceptor tropism by clinical factors, tropism assay should be performed before treatment with the CCR5 antagonist.\",\"Viral reprogramming of host cells enhances replication and is initiated by viral interaction with the cell surface. Upon human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binding to CD4+ T cells, a signal transduction cascade is initiated that reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton, activates transcription factors, and alters mRNA splicing pathways. We used a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic approach to investigate signal transduction cascades initiated by CCR5-tropic HIV, which accounts for virtually all transmitted viruses and the vast majority of viruses worldwide. CCR5-HIV signaling induced significant reprogramming of the actin cytoskeleton and mRNA splicing pathways, as previously described. In addition, CCR5-HIV signaling induced profound changes to the mRNA transcription, processing, translation, and post-translational modifications pathways, indicating that virtually every stage of protein production is affected. Furthermore, we identified two kinases regulated by CCR5-HIV signaling-p70-S6K1 (RPS6KB1) and MK2 (MAPKAPK2)-that were also required for optimal HIV infection of CD4+ T cells. These kinases regulate protein translation and cytoskeletal architecture, respectively, reinforcing the importance of these pathways in viral replication. Additionally, we found that blockade of CCR5 signaling by maraviroc had relatively modest effects on CCR5-HIV signaling, in agreement with reports that signaling by CCR5 is dispensable for HIV infection but in contrast to the critical effects of CXCR4 on cortical actin reorganization. These results demonstrate that CCR5-tropic HIV induces significant reprogramming of host CD4+ T cell protein production pathways and identifies two novel kinases induced upon viral binding to the cell surface that are critical for HIV replication in host cells.\",\"The phase III RV144 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine trial conducted in Thailand remains the only study to show efficacy in decreasing the HIV acquisition risk. In Thailand, circulating recombinant forms of HIV clade A/E (CRF01_AE) predominate; in such viruses, <i>env</i> originates from clade E (HIV-E). We constructed a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimera carrying <i>env</i> isolated from an RV144 placebo recipient in the SHIV-1157ipd3N4 backbone. The latter contains long terminal repeats (LTRs) with duplicated NF-\\u03baB sites, thus resembling HIV LTRs. We devised a novel strategy to adapt the parental infectious molecular clone (IMC), R5 SHIV-E1, to rhesus macaques: the simultaneous depletion of B and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells followed by the intramuscular inoculation of proviral DNA and repeated administrations of cell-free virus. High-level viremia and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell depletion ensued. Passage 3 virus unexpectedly caused acute, irreversible CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell loss; the partially adapted SHIV had become dual tropic. Virus and IMCs with exclusive R5 tropism were reisolated from earlier passages, combined, and used to complete adaptation through additional macaques. The final isolate, SHIV-E1p5, remained solely R5 tropic. It had a tier 2 neutralization phenotype, was mucosally transmissible, and was pathogenic. Deep sequencing revealed 99% Env amino acid sequence conservation; X4-only and dual-tropic strains had evolved independently from an early branch of parental SHIV-E1. To conclude, our primate model data reveal that SHIV-E1p5 recapitulates important aspects of HIV transmission and pathobiology in humans.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Understanding the protective principles that lead to a safe, effective vaccine against HIV in nonhuman primate (NHP) models requires test viruses that allow the evaluation of anti-HIV envelope responses. Reduced HIV acquisition risk in RV144 has been linked to nonneutralizing IgG antibodies with a range of effector activities. Definitive experiments to decipher the mechanisms of the partial protection observed in RV144 require passive-immunization studies in NHPs with a relevant test virus. We have generated such a virus by inserting <i>env</i> from an RV144 placebo recipient into a SHIV backbone with HIV-like LTRs. The final SHIV-E1p5 isolate, grown in rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells, was mucosally transmissible and pathogenic. Earlier SHIV-E passages showed a coreceptor switch, again mimicking HIV biology in humans. Thus, our series of SHIV-E strains mirrors HIV transmission and disease progression in humans. SHIV-E1p5 represents a biologically relevant tool to assess prevention strategies.\",\"Despite combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV+ patients still develop neurological disorders, which may be due to persistent HIV infection and selective evolution in brain tissues. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology offers an improved opportunity to study the relationship among HIV isolates in the brain and lymphoid tissues because it is capable of generating thousands of long sequence reads in a single run. Here, we used SMRT sequencing to generate ~\\u200950,000 high-quality full-length HIV envelope sequences (>\\u20092200\\u00a0bp) from seven autopsy tissues from an HIV+/cART+ subject, including three brain and four non-brain sites. Sanger sequencing was used for comparison with SMRT data and to clone functional pseudoviruses for in vitro tropism assays. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that brain-derived HIV was compartmentalized from HIV outside the brain and that the variants from each of the three brain tissues grouped independently. Variants from all peripheral tissues were intermixed on the tree but independent of the brain clades. Due to the large number of sequences, a clustering analysis at three similarity thresholds (99, 99.5, and 99.9%) was also performed. All brain sequences clustered exclusive of any non-brain sequences at all thresholds; however, frontal lobe sequences clustered independently of occipital and parietal lobes. Translated sequences revealed potentially functional differences between brain and non-brain sequences in the location of putative N-linked glycosylation sites (N-sites), V1 length, V3 charge, and the number of V4 N-sites. All brain sequences were predicted to use the CCR5 co-receptor, while most non-brain sequences were predicted to use CXCR4 co-receptor. Tropism results were confirmed by in vitro infection assays. The study is the first to use a SMRT sequencing approach to study HIV compartmentalization in tissues and supports other reports of limited trafficking between brain and non-brain sequences during cART. Due to the long sequence length, we could observe changes along the entire envelope gene, likely caused by differential selective pressure in the brain that may contribute to neurological disease.\",\"Entry inhibitors, such as Maraviroc, bind to CCR5 inhibiting entry of CCR5 utilizing viruses (R5 viruses). In the course of HIV infection, CXCR4 utilizing viruses (X4 viruses) may emerge and outgrow R5 viruses, and potentially limit the effectiveness of Maraviroc. The use of Maraviroc is reserved for salvage therapy in South Africa. In this study, we examined the frequency of R5 and X4 viruses, using next generation sequencing, in patients under treatment to draw inferences on the utility of Maraviroc in a South African population. Proviral DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 72 chronically HIV infected patients on antiretroviral treatment. HIV V3 loop gene was amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq platform. Viral subtypes were determined by the jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM) and REGA genotyping tools. De Novo consensus sequences were derived for the majority and minority populations for each patient using Geneious<sup>\\u00ae</sup> software version 8.1.5. HIV-1 tropism was inferred using PSSMsinsi, Geno2pheno and Phenoseq-C web-based tools. Quality V3 loop sequences were obtained from 72 patients, with 5 years (range: 0-16) median duration on treatment. Subtypes A1, B and C viruses were identified at frequencies of 4% (3/72), 4% (3/72) and 92% (66/72) respectively. Fifty four percent (39/72) of patients exclusively harboured R5 viral quasispecies; and 21% (15/72) exclusively harbored X4 viral quasispecies. Twenty five percent of patients (18/72) harbored dual/mixture of R5X4 quasispecies. Of these 18 patients, about 28% (5/18) harbored the R5+X4, a mixture with a majority R5 and minority X4 viruses, while about 72% (13/18) harbored the R5X4+ mixture with a majority X4 and minority R5 viruses. The proportion of all patients who harbored X4 viruses either exclusively or dual/mixture was 46% (33/72). Thirty-five percent (23/66) of the patients who were of HIV-1 subtype C harboured X4 viruses (\\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\\u202f=\\u202f3.58; p\\u202f=\\u202f.058), and 57% of these (13/23) harbored X4 viruses exclusively. CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count less than 350 cell/\\u03bcl was associated with the presence of X4 viruses (\\u03c7<sup>2</sup>\\u202f=\\u202f4.99; p\\u202f=\\u202f.008). The effectiveness of Maraviroc as a component in salvage therapy may be compromised for a significant number of chronically infected patients harboring CXCR4 utilizing viruses.\",\"Pandemic HIV-1 originated from the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz, which infects chimpanzees, while SIVcpz itself emerged following the cross-species transmission and recombination of monkey SIVs, with env contributed by the SIVgsn/mus/mon lineage that infects greater spot-nosed, mustached and mona monkeys. SIVcpz and HIV-1 are pathogenic in their respective hosts, while the phenotype of their SIVgsn/mus/mon ancestors is unknown. However, two well-studied SIV infected natural hosts, sooty mangabeys (SMs) and African green monkeys (AGMs), typically remain healthy despite high viral loads; these species express low levels of the canonical coreceptor CCR5, and recent work shows that CXCR6 is a major coreceptor for SIV in these hosts. It is not known what coreceptors were used by the precursors of SIVcpz, whether coreceptor use changed during emergence of the SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineage, and what T cell subsets express CXCR6 in natural hosts. Using species-matched coreceptors and CD4, we show here that SIVcpz uses only CCR5 for entry and, like HIV-1, cannot use CXCR6. In contrast, SIVmus efficiently uses both CXCR6 and CCR5. Coreceptor selectivity was determined by Env, with CXCR6 use abrogated by Pro326 in the V3 crown, which is absent in monkey SIVs but highly conserved in SIVcpz/HIV-1. To characterize which cells express CXCR6, we generated a novel antibody that recognizes CXCR6 of multiple primate species. Testing lymphocytes from SM, the best-studied natural host, we found that CXCR6 is restricted to CD4+ effector memory cells, and is expressed by a sub-population distinct from those expressing CCR5. Thus, efficient CXCR6 use, previously identified in SM and AGM infection, also characterizes a member of the SIV lineage that gave rise to SIVcpz/HIV-1. Loss of CXCR6 usage by SIVcpz may have altered its cell tropism, shifting virus from CXCR6-expressing cells that may support replication without disrupting immune function or homeostasis, towards CCR5-expressing cells with pathogenic consequences.\",\"The influence of HIV-1 co-receptor usage on the course of therapy in subjects fully responding to ART has been poorly investigated. To explore the relationship between co-receptor tropism and cellular reservoir size, residual viremia and subsequent virological outcome in ART-treated patients with HIV-1 RNA stable <50 copies/mL. Viral co-receptor usage was predicted by viral env DNA sequencing with geno2pheno interpretation (FPR20%) and classified as R5 and non-R5. Total blood-associated HIV-1 DNA levels (log<sub>10</sub> copies/10<sup>6</sup> leukocytes) were measured by qRT-PCR (5'LTR). Residual plasma viremia was categorized as detectable (1-49 cps/mL) or undetectable (<1 copy/mL). Virological rebounds (any HIV-1 RNA >50 copies/mL) were evaluated over 96 weeks. The study included 116 subjects. Patients with R5 virus (n\\u202f=\\u202f59) and non-R5 virus (n\\u202f=\\u202f57) were homogeneous for the main characteristics except for the lower nadir CD4 cell count in the non-R5 group. Patients with non-R5 variants showed higher levels of HIV-1 DNA as compared to patients with R5 virus: mean 2.47 (95% CI 2.37-2.56) vs 2.17 (2.08-2.26) (p\\u202f<\\u202f0.001). Moreover, a higher proportion of patients in the non-R5 group displayed detectable residual viremia with respect to the R5-group (54.4% vs 32.2%, p\\u202f=\\u202f.016). Detectable residual viremia was found to be significantly associated with viral rebounds. The presence of non-R5 viral DNA variants is related to a higher probability of residual viremia and to a larger size of the cellular viral reservoir in this setting. These data highlight a potential role of viral tropism in the monitoring of HIV-1 infection in virologically controlled subject.\",\"Female genital epithelial cells cover the genital tract and provide the first line of protection against infection with sexually transmitted pathogenic viruses. These cells normally are impervious to HIV-1. We report that coinfection of cells by HIV-1 and another sexually transmitted virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), led to production of HIV-1 that had expanded cell tropism and was able to directly infect primary vaginal and cervical epithelial cells. HIV-1 infection of epithelial cells was blocked by neutralizing antibodies against the HTLV-1 envelope (Env) protein, indicating that the infection was mediated through HTLV-1 Env pseudotyping of HIV-1. Active replication of HIV-1 in epithelial cells was demonstrated by inhibition with anti-HIV-1 drugs. We demonstrated that HIV-1 derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-HTLV-1-coinfected subjects could infect primary epithelial cells in an HTLV-1 Env-dependent manner. HIV-1 from subjects infected with HIV-1 alone was not able to infect epithelial cells. These results indicate that pseudotyping of HIV-1 with HTLV-1 Env can occur <i>in vivo</i> Our data further reveal that active replication of both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 is required for production of pseudotyped HIV-1. Our findings indicate that pseudotyping of HIV-1 with HTLV-1 Env in coinfected cells enabled HIV-1 to directly infect nonpermissive female genital epithelial cells. This phenomenon may represent a risk factor for enhanced sexual transmission of HIV-1 in regions where virus coinfection is common.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Young women in certain regions of the world are at very high risk of acquiring HIV-1, and there is an urgent need to identify the factors that promote HIV-1 transmission. HIV-1 infection is frequently accompanied by infection with other pathogenic viruses. We demonstrate that coinfection of cells by HIV-1 and HTLV-1 can lead to production of HIV-1 pseudotyped with HTLV-1 Env that is able to directly infect female genital epithelial cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> Given the function of these epithelial cells as genital mucosal barriers to pathogenic virus transmission, the ability of HIV-1 pseudotyped with HTLV-1 Env to directly infect female genital epithelial cells represents a possible factor for increased risk of sexual transmission of HIV-1. This mechanism could be especially impactful in settings such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are both highly prevalent.\",\"With limited and low-genetic barrier drugs used for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, vertically transmitted HIV-1 drug-resistance (HIVDR) is concerning and might prompt optimal pediatric strategies.The aim of this study was to ascertain HIVDR and viral-tropism in majority and minority populations among Cameroonian vertically infected children.A comparative analysis among 18 HIV-infected children (7 from PMTCT-exposed mothers and 11 from mothers without PMTCT-exposure) was performed. HIVDR and HIV-1 co-receptor usage was evaluated by analyzing sequences obtained by both Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep 454-pyrosequencing (UDPS), set at 1% threshold.Overall, median (interquartile range) age, viremia, and CD4 count were 6 (4-10) years, 5.5 (4.9-6.0) log10 copies/mL, and 526 (282-645) cells/mm, respectively. All children had wild-type viruses through both Sanger sequencing and UDPS, except for 1 PMTCT-exposed infant harboring minority K103N (8.31%), born to a mother exposed to AZT+3TC+NVP. X4-tropic viruses were found in 5 of 15 (33.3%) children (including 2 cases detected only by UDPS). Rate of X4-tropic viruses was 0% (0/6) below 5 years (also as minority species), and became relatively high above 5 years (55.6% [5/9], P = .040. X4-tropic viruses were higher with CD4 \\u226415% (4/9 [44.4%]) versus CD4 >15% (1/6 [16.7%], P = .580); similarly for CD4 \\u2264200 (3/4 [75%]) versus CD4 >200 (2/11 [18.2%] cells/mm, P = .077.NGS has the ability of excluding NRTI- and NNRTI-mutations as minority species in all but 1 children, thus supporting the safe use of these drug-classes in those without such mutations, henceforth sparing ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors or integrase inhibitors for the few remaining cases. In children under five years, X4-tropic variants would be rare, suggesting vertical-transmission with CCR5-tropic viruses and possible maraviroc usage at younger ages.\",\"Adequate information on the precise molecular and biological composition of the viral strains that establish HIV infection in the human host will provide effective means of immunization against HIV infection. In an attempt to identify the transmitted founder (TF) virus and differentiate the biological properties and infectious potential of the TF virus from those of the population of the early transmitted viruses, 250 patient-derived gp120 envelope glycoproteins were cloned in pMN-K7-Luc-IRESs-Nef\\u0394gp120 to obtain chimeric viruses. Samples were obtained from eight infants who had recently become infected with HIV through mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and two adults who acquired infection through the heterosexual route and were in the chronic stage of infection. Among the 250 clones tested, 65 chimeric viruses were infectious, and all belonged to HIV-1 subtype C. The 65 clones were analyzed for molecular features of the envelope, per-infectious-particle infectivity, coreceptor tropism, drug sensitivity, and sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Based on genotypic and phenotypic analysis of the viral clones, we identified 10 TF viruses from the eight infants. The TF viruses were characterized by shorter V1V2 regions, a reduced number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and a higher infectivity titer compared to the virus variants from the adults in the chronic stage of infection. CXCR6 coreceptor usage, in addition to that of the CCR5 coreceptor, which was used by all 65 chimeric viruses, was identified in 13 viruses. The sensitivity of the TF variants to maraviroc and a standard panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (VRC01, PG09, PG16, and PGT121) was found to be much lower than that of the virus variants from the adults in the chronic stage of infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Tremendous progress has been made during the last three and half decades of HIV research, but some significant gaps continue to exist. One of the frontier areas of HIV research which has not seen a breakthrough yet is vaccine research, which is because of the enormous genetic diversity of HIV-1 and the unique infectious fitness of the virus. Among the repertoire of viral variants, the virus that establishes successful infection (transmitted founder [TF] virus) has not been well characterized yet. An insight into the salient features of the TF virus would go a long way toward helping with the design of an effective vaccine against HIV. Here we studied the biological properties of recently transmitted viruses isolated from infants who acquired infection from the mother and have come up with unique characterizations for the TF virus that establishes infection in the human host.\",\"Through a twist of fate the most common form of HIV-1, as defined by entry phenotype, was not appreciated until recently. The entry phenotype is closely linked to the target cell and thus to virus-host interactions and pathogenesis. The most abundant form of HIV-1 uses CCR5 as the coreceptor and requires a high density of CD4 for efficient entry, defining its target cell as the CD4+ memory T cell. This is the transmitted form of the virus, the form that is found in the blood, and the form that rebounds from the latent reservoir. When CD4+/CCR5+ T cells become limiting the virus evolves to use alternative target cells to support viral replication. In the CNS, the virus can evolve to use a cell that displays only a low density of CD4, while maintaining the use of CCR5 as the coreceptor. When this evolutionary variant evolves, it must be sustaining its replication in either macrophages or microglial cells, which display only a low density of CD4 relative to that on T cells. In the blood and lymphoid system, the major switch late in disease is from T cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 to T cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4, with a change in coreceptor specificity. Thus the virus responds in two different ways to different environments when its preferred target cell becomes limiting.\",\"In vitro, gp120 of both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains activates human hepatic stellate cells, but if it can promote liver fibrosis in vivo is unknown. We aimed to evaluate if patients carrying X4 or R5 strains have a different liver fibrosis (LF) progression over time. A total of 1,137 HIV-infected patients in ICONA cohort (21% females, 7% HCV co-infected) with an available determination of HIV-1 co-receptor tropism (CRT), a Fibrosis-4 Index for Liver Fibrosis (FIB-4) <3.25 and at least one-year follow-up were included. CRT was assessed by gp120 sequencing on plasma RNA and geno2pheno algorithm (10% false positive rate) or by Trofile. LF was assessed by means of FIB-4. LF progression was defined as an absolute score increase or a transition to higher fibrosis stratum and/or occurrence of liver-related clinical events. A total of 249 (22%) patients carried X4 strains, which were associated with older age, lower CD4 count, lower nadir CD4, and intravenous drug use. Overall, X4 and R5 patients had similar baseline FIB-4 scores and similar mean FIB-4 slope after a median follow-up of 35 months. There was no difference between X4 and R5 for time to LF progression (p = 0.925). Estimated risk of LF at 24 months (95% CI) after baseline in X4 and R5 was 10.6% (8.3-12.9) and 9.9% (5.9-14.0), respectively. Age, HCV co-infection, diabetes, HIV-duration, HIV-RNA>100.000 cp/mL, antiretroviral therapy exposure were associated with LF progression at multivariate analysis. A slight LF progression over time was observed in HIV-infected patients. No difference was demonstrated for X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains in accelerating LF evolution.\",\"Dendritic cell (DC)-to-T cell transmission is an example of infection in trans, in which the cell transmitting the virus is itself uninfected. During this mode of DC-to-T cell transmission, uninfected DCs concentrate infectious virions, contact T cells and transmit these virions to target cells. Here, we investigated the efficiency of DC-to-T cell transmission on the number of cells infected and the sensitivity of this type of transmission to the antiretroviral drugs tenofovir (TFV) and raltegravir (RAL). We observed activated monocyte-derived and myeloid DCs amplified T cell infection, which resulted in drug insensitivity. This drug insensitivity was dependent on cell-to-cell contact and ratio of DCs to T cells in coculture. DC-mediated amplification of HIV-1 infection was efficient regardless of virus tropism or origin. The DC-to-T cell transmission of the T/F strain CH077.t/2627 was relatively insensitive to TFV compared to DC-free T cell infection. The input of virus modulated the drug sensitivity of DC-to-T cell infection, but not T cell infection by cell-free virus. At high viral inputs, DC-to-T cell transmission reduced the sensitivity of infection to TFV. Transmission of HIV by DCs in trans may have important implications for viral persistence in vivo in environments, where residual replication may persist in the face of antiretroviral therapy.\",\"Many details of HIV-1 molecular virology have been translated into lifesaving antiviral drugs. Yet, we have an incomplete understanding of the cells in which HIV-1 replicates in untreated individuals and persists in during antiretroviral therapy. In this review we discuss how viral entry phenotypes have been characterized and the insights they have revealed about the target cells supporting HIV-1 replication. In addition, we will examine whether some HIV-1 variants have the ability to enter cells lacking CD4 (such as astrocytes) and the role that trans-infection plays in HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 entry into a target cell is determined by whether the viral receptor (CD4) and the coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) are expressed on that cell. Sustained HIV-1 replication in a cell type can produce viral lineages that are tuned to the CD4 density and coreceptor expressed on those cells; a fact that allows us to use Env protein entry phenotypes to infer information about the cells in which a viral lineage has been replicating and adapting. We now recognize that HIV-1 variants can be divided into three classes representing the primary target cells of HIV-1; R5 T cell-tropic variants that are adapted to entering memory CD4+ T cells, X4 T cell-tropic variants that are adapted to entering na\\u00efve CD4+ T cells and Mtropic variants that are adapted to entering macrophages and possibly other cells that express low levels of CD4. While much progress has been made, the relative contribution that infection of different cell subsets makes to viral pathogenesis and persistence is still being unraveled.\",\"Going back to their discovery in the early 1980s, both the Human T-cell Leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) greatly fascinated the virology scene, not only because they were the first human retroviruses discovered, but also because they were associated with fatal diseases in the human population. In almost four decades of scientific research, both viruses have had different fates, HTLV-1 being often upstaged by HIV-1. However, although being very close in terms of genome organization, cellular tropism, and viral replication, HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are not completely commutable in terms of treatment, especially because of the opposite fate of the cells they infect: death versus immortalization, respectively. Nowadays, the antiretroviral therapies developed to treat HIV-1 infected individuals and to limit HIV-1 spread among the human population have a poor or no effect on HTLV-1 infected individuals, and thus, do not prevent the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases, which still lack highly efficient treatments. The present review mainly focuses on the course of HTLV-1 infection, from the initial infection of the host to diseases development and associated treatments, but also investigates HIV-1/HTLV-1 co-infection events and their impact on diseases development.\",\"Pathogenic HIV-1 infection of humans and SIVmac infection of macaques are the result of zoonotic transfer of primate immunodeficiency viruses from their natural hosts into non-natural host species. Natural host infections do not result in pathogenesis despite high levels of virus replication, and evidence suggests that differences in anatomical location and specific subsets of CD4+ T cells infected may underlie distinct outcomes from infection. The coreceptor CCR5 has long been considered the sole pathway for SIV entry and the key determinant of CD4+ cell targeting, but it has also been known that natural hosts express exceedingly low levels of CCR5 despite maintaining high levels of virus replication. This review details emerging data indicating that in multiple natural host species, CCR5 is dispensable for SIV infection ex vivo and/or in vivo and, contrary to the established dogma, alternative coreceptors, particularly CXCR6, play a central role in infection and cell targeting. Infections of non-natural hosts, however, are characterized by CCR5-exclusive entry. These findings suggest that alternative coreceptor-mediated cell targeting in natural hosts, combined with low CCR5 expression, may direct the virus to distinct populations of cells that are dispensable for immune homeostasis, particularly extralymphoid and more differentiated CD4+ T cells. In contrast, CCR5-mediated entry in non-natural hosts results in targeting of CD4+ T cells that are located in lymphoid tissues, critical for immune homeostasis, or necessary for gut barrier integrity. Thus, fundamental differences in viral entry coreceptor use may be central determinants of infection outcome. These findings redefine the normal SIV/host relationship in natural host species, shed new light on key features linked to zoonotic immunodeficiency virus transfer, and highlight important questions regarding how and why this coreceptor bottleneck occurs and the coevolutionary equilibrium is lost following cross-species transfer that results in AIDS.\",\"Cellular tropism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is closely linked to interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) with CD4 and chemokine receptor family members, CCR5 and CXCR4. This interaction plays a key role in determining anatomic sites that are infected in vivo and the cascade of early and late events that result in chronic immune activation, immunosuppression and ultimately, AIDS. CD4+ T cells are critical to adaptive immune responses, and their early and rapid infection in gut lamina propria and secondary lymphoid tissues in susceptible hosts likely contributes to viral persistence and progression to disease. CD4+ macrophages are also infected, although their role in HIV-1 pathogenesis is more controversial. Pathogenic infection by simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) in Asian macaques as models of HIV-1 infection has enabled the impact of cellular tropism on pathogenesis to be directly probed. This review will highlight examples in which experimental interventions during SIV infection or the introduction of viral mutations have altered cellular tropism and, subsequently, pathogenesis. Alterations to the interaction of Env and its cellular receptors has been shown to result in changes to CD4 dependence, coreceptor specificity, and viral tropism for gut CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Collectively, these findings have yielded novel insights into the critical role of the viral Env and tropism as a driver of pathogenesis and host control and have helped to identify new areas for targeted interventions in therapy and prevention of HIV-1 infection.\",\"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs), released by a wide variety of cell types, carry donor origin-proteins, cytokines, and nucleic acids, transport these cargos to adjacent or distant specific recipient cells, and thereby regulate gene expression and activation of target cells. In this study, we isolated and identified exosomes in rhesus macaques, and investigated their effects on cell tropism and activation, especially their potential to reactivate HIV latency. The results indicated that plasma-derived exosomes preferentially fuse to TCR-activated T cells and autologous parent cells. Importantly, the uptake of exosomes, derived from IL-2 stimulated CD4+ T cells, effectively promoted reactivation of resting CD4+ T-cell, as indicated by an increased viral transcription rate in these cells. These findings provide premise for the potential application of exosome in the reactivation of HIV latency, in combination its use as functional delivery vehicles with antiretroviral therapy (ART).\",\"HIV-1 R5 variants exploit CCR5 as a coreceptor to infect both T cells and macrophages. R5 viruses that are transmitted or derived from immune tissue and peripheral blood are mainly inefficient at mediating infection of macrophages. In contrast, highly macrophage-tropic (mac-tropic) R5 viruses predominate in brain tissue and can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid but are infrequent in immune tissue or blood even in late disease. These mac-tropic R5 variants carry envelope glycoproteins (Envs) adapted to exploit low levels of CD4 on macrophages to induce infection. However, it is unclear whether this adaptation is conferred by an increased affinity of the Env trimer for CD4 or is mediated by postbinding structural rearrangements in the trimer that enhance the exposure of the coreceptor binding site and facilitate events leading to fusion and virus entry. In this study, we investigated CD4 binding to mac-tropic and non-mac-tropic Env trimers and showed that CD4-IgG binds efficiently to mac-tropic R5 Env trimers, while binding to non-mac-tropic trimers was undetectable. Our data indicated that the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) is highly occluded on Env trimers of non-mac-tropic R5 viruses. Such viruses may therefore infect T cells via viral synapses where Env and CD4 become highly concentrated. This environment will enable high-avidity interactions that overcome extremely low Env-CD4 affinities.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> HIV R5 variants bind to CD4 and CCR5 receptors on T cells and macrophages to initiate infection. Transmitted HIV variants infect T cells but not macrophages, and these viral strains persist in immune tissue even in late disease. Here we show that the binding site for CD4 present on HIV's envelope protein is occluded on viruses replicating in immune tissue. This occlusion likely prevents antibody binding to this site and neutralization of the virus, but it makes it difficult for virus-CD4 interactions to occur. Such viruses probably pass from T cell to T cell via cell contacts where CD4 is highly concentrated and allows infection via inefficient envelope-CD4 binding. Our data are highly relevant for vaccines that aim to induce antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site on the envelope protein.\",\"The natural clinical and immunological courses following HIV seroconversion with CXCR4-tropic or dual-mixed (X4/DM) viruses are controversial. We compared spontaneous immunological outcome in patients harbouring an X4/DM virus at the time of seroconversion with those harbouring a CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. Data were included from patients participating in CASCADE, a large cohort collaboration of HIV seroconverters, with \\u22652\\u2009years of follow-up since seroconversion. The HIV envelope gene was sequenced from frozen plasma samples collected at enrolment, and HIV tropism was determined using Geno2Pheno (false-positive rate 10%). The spontaneous CD4 T cell evolution was compared by modelling CD4 kinetics using linear mixed-effects models with random intercept and random slope. A total of 1387 patients were eligible. Median time between seroconversion and enrolment was 1\\u2009month (range 0-3). At enrolment, 202 of 1387 (15%) harboured an X4/DM-tropic virus. CD4 decrease slopes were not significantly different according to HIV-1 tropism during the first 30\\u2009months after seroconversion. No marked change in these results was found after adjusting for age, year of seroconversion and baseline HIV viral load. Time to antiretroviral treatment initiation was not statistically different between patients harbouring an R5 (20.76\\u2009months) and those harbouring an X4/DM-tropic virus (22.86\\u2009months, logrank test P\\u2009=\\u20090.32). Conclusions: In this large cohort collaboration, 15% of the patients harboured an X4/DM virus close to HIV seroconversion. Patients harbouring X4/DM-tropic viruses close to seroconversion did not have an increased risk of disease progression, estimated by the decline in CD4 T cell count or time to combined ART initiation.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope gp120 is partly an intrinsically disordered (unstructured/disordered) protein as it contains regions that do not fold into well-defined protein structures. These disordered regions play important roles in HIV's life cycle, particularly, V3 loop-dependent cell entry, which determines how the virus uses two coreceptors on immune cells, the chemokine receptors CCR5 (R5), CXCR4 (X4) or both (R5X4 virus). Most infecting HIV-1 variants utilise CCR5, while a switch to CXCR4-use occurs in the majority of infections. Why does this 'rewiring' event occur in HIV-1 infected patients? As changes in the charge of the V3 loop are associated with this receptor switch and it has been suggested that charged residues promote structure disorder, we hypothesise that the intrinsic disorder of the V3 loop is permissive to sequence variation thus contributing to the switch in cell tropism. To test this we use three independent data sets of gp120 to analyse V3 loop disorder. We find that the V3 loop of X4 virus has significantly higher intrinsic disorder tendency than R5 and R5X4 virus, while R5X4 virus has the lowest. These results indicate that structural disorder plays an important role in HIV-1 cell tropism and CXCR4 binding. We discuss the potential evolutionary mechanisms leading to the fixation of disorder promoting mutations and the adaptive potential of protein structural disorder in viral host adaptation.\",\"HIV and viral hepatitis infections are major causes of chronic disease worldwide and have some similarities with regard to routes of transmission, epidemiology, front barriers faced during access of treatment, and strategies for a global public health response. The objective was to describe the HIV-1 subtypes, viral tropism and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interleukin 28B (IL28B) from a case series of HIV/viral hepatitis coinfected patients from southern Brazil. Clinical and epidemiological data were evaluated by a review of medical records. Periodic blood draws were taken to determine the viral and host characteristics. This study included 38 patients with HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV coinfection; the median age was 49 years. Thirty-seven (97.4%) were on antiretroviral therapy, 32 (84.2%) had an undetectable viral load, a median CD4+ T-cell count of 452 cells/mm3. HIV-1 subtyping showed 47.4 and 31.6% of patients with subtypes C and B, respectively. Analysis of viral co-receptor usage showed a predominance of the R5 variant (64.7%), with no significant difference between the subtypes. Twenty patients with HIV/HCV coinfection were eligible to receive HCV therapy with pegylated-interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, and 10/20 (50%) of them achieved sustained virological response. SNPs of IL28B were evaluated in 93.3% of patients with HIV/HCV coinfection, and 17 (60.7%) presented the CC genotype. In the present case series, a higher frequency of HIV subtype C was found in coinfected patients. However such findings need to be prospectively evaluated with the inclusion of data from regional multicenter analyses.\",\"A directed evolution approach was used to select for Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids that would exhibit more tropism toward an HIV-1 producer T cell line with the long-term goal of developing improved gene transfer vectors. A library of AAV variants was used to infect H9 T cells previously infected or uninfected by HIV-1 followed by AAV amplification with wild-type adenovirus. Six rounds of biological selection were performed, including negative selection and diversification after round three. The H9 T cells were successfully infected with all three wild-type viruses (AAV, adenovirus, and HIV-1). Four AAV cap mutants best representing the small number of variants emerging after six rounds of selection were chosen for further study. These mutant capsids were used to package an AAV vector and subsequently used to infect H9 cells that were previously infected or uninfected by HIV-1. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to measure cell-associated AAV genomes. Two of the four cap mutants showed a significant increase in the amount of cell-associated genomes as compared to wild-type AAV2. This study shows that directed evolution can be performed successfully to select for mutants with improved tropism for a T cell line in the presence of HIV-1.\",\"The functional polarization of CD4 T cells determines their antimicrobial effector profile, but may also impact the susceptibility to infection with HIV-1. Here, we analyzed the susceptibility of CD4 T cells with different functional polarization to infection with X4 and R5-tropic HIV-1. CD4 T cells with a Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th9 polarization were subjected to in-vitro infection assays with X4, R5, or vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein-pseudotyped HIV-1. In addition, we sorted differentially polarized CD4 T-cell subsets from individuals treated with antiretroviral therapy and analyzed the tropism of viral env sequences. Th9-polarized CD4 T cells and, to a lesser extent, Th2-polarized CD4 T cells expressed higher surface levels of CXCR4, and are more permissive to X4-tropic infection in vitro. In contrast, Th1 and Th17 CD4 T cells exhibited stronger surface expression of CCR5, and were more susceptible to infection with R5-tropic viruses. Correspondingly, the distribution of X4-tropic viral sequences in antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected patients was biased toward Th9/Th2 cells, whereas R5-tropic sequences were more frequently observed in Th17 cells. CD4 T-cell polarization is associated with a distinct susceptibility to X4 and R5-tropic HIV-1 infection.\",\"Untreated HIV-positive (HIV-1<sup>+</sup>) individuals frequently suffer from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), with about 30% of AIDS patients suffering severe HIV-associated dementias (HADs). Antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced the incidence of HAND and HAD. However, there is a continuing problem of milder neurocognitive impairments in treated HIV<sup>+</sup> patients that may be increasing with long-term therapy. In the present study, we investigated whether envelope (<i>env</i>) genes could be amplified from proviral DNA or RNA derived from brain tissue of 12 individuals with normal neurology or minor neurological conditions (N/MC individuals). The tropism and characteristics of the brain-derived Envs were then investigated and compared to those of Envs derived from immune tissue. We showed that (i) macrophage-tropic R5 Envs could be detected in the brain tissue of 4/12 N/MC individuals, (ii) macrophage-tropic Envs in brain tissue formed compartmentalized clusters distinct from non-macrophage-tropic (non-mac-tropic) Envs recovered from the spleen or brain, (iii) the evidence was consistent with active viral expression by macrophage-tropic variants in the brain tissue of some individuals, and (iv) Envs from immune tissue of the N/MC individuals were nearly all tightly non-mac-tropic, contrasting with previous data for neuro-AIDS patients where immune tissue Envs mediated a range of macrophage infectivities, from background levels to modest infection, with a small number of Envs from some patients mediating high macrophage infection levels. In summary, the data presented here show that compartmentalized and active macrophage-tropic HIV-1 variants are present in the brain tissue of individuals before neurological disease becomes overt or serious.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The detection of highly compartmentalized macrophage-tropic R5 Envs in the brain tissue of HIV patients without serious neurological disease is consistent with their emergence from a viral population already established there, perhaps from early disease. The detection of active macrophage-tropic virus expression, and probably replication, indicates that antiretroviral drugs with optimal penetration through the blood-brain barrier should be considered even for patients without neurological disease (neuro-disease). Finally, our data are consistent with the brain forming a sanctuary site for latent virus and low-level viral replication in the absence of neuro-disease.\",\"HIV-1 entry into target cells influences several aspects of HIV-1 pathogenesis, including viral tropism, HIV-1 transmission and disease progression, and response to entry inhibitors. The evolution from CCR5- to CXCR4-using strains in a given human host is still unpredictable. Here we analyzed timing and predictors for coreceptor evolution among recently HIV-1-infected individuals. Proviral DNA was longitudinally evaluated in 66 individuals using Geno2pheno<sub>[coreceptor]</sub> Demographics, viral load, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts, CCR5\\u039432 polymorphisms, GB virus C (GBV-C) coinfection, and HLA profiles were also evaluated. Ultradeep sequencing was performed on initial samples from 11 selected individuals. A tropism switch from CCR5- to CXCR4-using strains was identified in 9/49 (18.4%) individuals. Only a low baseline false-positive rate (FPR) was found to be a significant tropism switch predictor. No minor CXCR4-using variants were identified in initial samples of 4 of 5 R5/non-R5 switchers. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with an FPR of >40.6% at baseline presented a stable FPR over time whereas lower FPRs tend to progressively decay, leading to emergence of CXCR4-using strains, with a mean evolution time of 27.29 months (range, 8.90 to 64.62). An FPR threshold above 40.6% determined by logistic regression analysis may make it unnecessary to further determine tropism for prediction of disease progression related to emergence of X4 strains or use of CCR5 antagonists. The detection of variants with intermediate FPRs and progressive FPR decay over time not only strengthens the power of Geno2pheno in predicting HIV tropism but also indirectly confirms a continuous evolution from earlier R5 variants toward CXCR4-using strains.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The introduction of CCR5 antagonists in the antiretroviral arsenal has sparked interest in coreceptors utilized by HIV-1. Despite concentrated efforts, viral and human host features predicting tropism switch are still poorly understood. Limited longitudinal data are available to assess the influence that these factors have on predicting tropism switch and disease progression. The present study describes longitudinal tropism evolution in a group of recently HIV-infected individuals to determine the prevalence and potential correlates of tropism switch. We demonstrated here that a low baseline FPR determined by the Geno2pheno<sub>[coreceptor]</sub> algorithm can predict tropism evolution from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor use.\",\"Quality Assurance (QA) programs are essential to evaluate performance in diagnostics laboratories. We present the results from the first QA for HIV-1 genotypic tropism testing, organized and coordinated by the Institute of Virology at the University of Cologne. 12 cell culture-derived viral strains of different HIV-1 clades from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program were sent to the participants to be processed with their standard diagnostic methods Fasta files containing the V3 region sequence were centrally analyzed at the Institute of Virology, Cologne. All samples were sent in parallel for phenotypic testing. 36 laboratories from 16 countries reported genotypic results. The sequence-generation efficacy was 95.1%, while the phenotypic assays ESTA<sup>\\u00ae</sup> and PhenXR only achieved results for 58.3% of the samples. All four X4 samples were identified by 31/36 laboratories, two laboratories amplified 3/4\\u00d74 samples, and three detected 2/4\\u00d74 samples. There was high concordance among the genotypic and phenotypic results, although differences in FPR values were detected. Most deficiencies in sequence editing did not result in wrong classification of X4 viruses as R5, with the exception of sample NRZ05 by laboratory 38, but in an overestimation of CXCR4 use. This demonstrates that genotypic tropism prediction is a safe procedure for clinical purposes. As we used homogeneous cell culture samples and all sequence fasta files were centrally analyzed, variations in FPR values can only be attributed to sample preparation, RT-PCR or sequence editing protocols.\",\"HIV-1 is known to adapt to the local environment in its usage of receptors, and it can become CD4 independent in the brain where the receptor is scarce. This adaptation is through amino acid variations, but the patterns of such variation are not yet well understood. Given that infection of long-lived CD4-low and CD4-negative cells in anatomical compartments such as the brain expands cell tropism in vivo and may serve as potential viral reservoirs that pose challenge for HIV eradication, understanding the evolution to CD4 independence and envelope conformation associated with infection in the absence of CD4 will not only broaden our insights into HIV pathogenesis but may guide functional cure strategies as well. We characterize, by site-directed mutagenesis, neutralization assay, and structural analysis, a pair of CD4-dependent (cl2) and CD4-independent (cl20) envelopes concurrently isolated from the cerebral spinal fluid of an SHIV-infected macaque with neurological AIDS and with minimum sequence differences. Residues different between cl2 and cl20 are mapped to the V1V2 and surrounding regions. Mutations of these residues in cl2 increased its CD4 independence in infection, and the effects are cumulative and likely structural. Our data suggested that the determinants of CD4 independence in vivo mapped principally to V1V2 of gp120 that can destabilize the apex of the envelope spike, with an additional change in V4 that abrogated a potential N-linked glycan to facilitate movement of the V1V2 domain and further expose the coreceptor-binding site.\",\"Follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in secondary lymphoid follicles. TFR cells were previously included in the follicular helper T (TFH) cell subset, which consists of cells that are highly permissive to HIV-1. The permissivity of TFR cells to HIV-1 is unknown. We find that TFR cells are more permissive than TFH cells to R5-tropic HIV-1 <i>ex vivo</i> TFR cells expressed more CCR5 and CD4 and supported higher frequencies of viral fusion. Differences in Ki67 expression correlated with HIV-1 replication. Inhibiting cellular proliferation reduced Ki67 expression and HIV-1 replication. Lymph node cells from untreated HIV-infected individuals revealed that TFR cells harbored the highest concentrations of HIV-1 RNA and highest levels of Ki67 expression. These data demonstrate that TFR cells are highly permissive to R5-tropic HIV-1 both <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> This is likely related to elevated CCR5 levels combined with a heightened proliferative state and suggests that TFR cells contribute to persistent R5-tropic HIV-1 replication <i>in vivo</i><b>IMPORTANCE</b> In chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection, viral replication is concentrated in secondary lymphoid follicles. Within secondary lymphoid follicles, follicular helper T (TFH) cells have previously been shown to be highly permissive to HIV-1. Recently, another subset of T cells in secondary lymphoid follicles was described, follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells. These cells share some phenotypic characteristics with TFH cells, and studies that showed that TFH cells are highly permissive to HIV-1 included TFR cells in their definition of TFH cells. The permissivity of TFR cells to HIV-1 has not previously been described. Here, we show that TFR cells are highly permissive to HIV-1 both <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> The expression of Ki67, a marker of proliferative capacity, is predictive of expression of viral proteins, and downregulating Ki67 leads to concurrent decreases in expression of viral proteins. Our study provides new insight into HIV-1 replication and a potential new cell type to target for future treatment.\",\"Macrophages are a target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and may serve as an important reservoir of the virus in the body, particularly after depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in HIV/AIDS. Recently, sterile alpha motif and histidine/aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) was identified as the major restriction factor of HIV-1 infection in myeloid cells. SAMHD1 is targeted for proteolytic degradation by Vpx, a viral protein encoded by HIV-2 and many simian immunodeficiency viruses but not HIV-1. In this study, we assessed SAMHD1 restriction in in vitro differentiated macrophages and in freshly isolated macrophages from the lungs, abdomen, and brain. We found that infection and spread in in vitro cultured monocyte-derived macrophages were highly limited and that Vpx largely relieved the restriction to initial infection, as expected. We observed nearly identical infection and restriction profiles in freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes, as well as lung (alveolar) and abdominal (peritoneal) macrophages. In contrast, under the same infection conditions, primary brain macrophages (microglia) were highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection despite levels of endogenous SAMHD1 comparable to the other macrophage populations. Addition of Vpx further increased HIV-1 infection under conditions of limiting virus input, and viral spread was robust whether or not SAMHD1 was depleted. These results suggest that HIV-1 infection of peripherally circulating macrophages is effectively restricted by SAMHD1; however, microglia are highly susceptible to infection despite SAMHD1 expression. These data may explain the long-standing observation that HIV-1 infection is often detected in macrophages in the brain, but seldom in other tissues of the body.\",\"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are increasingly recognized as a major reservoir of HIV infection that will likely need to be addressed in approaches to curing HIV. However, Tfh express minimal CCR5, the major coreceptor for HIV-1, and the mechanism by which they are infected is unclear. We have previously shown that macaque Tfh lack CCR5, but are infected <i>in vivo</i> with CCR5-using SIV at levels comparable to other memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Similarly, human splenic Tfh cells are highly infected with HIV-1 DNA. Therefore, we set out to examine the mechanism of infection of Tfh cells. Tfh and other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets from macaque lymph nodes and spleens, splenic Tfh from HIV<sup>+</sup> subjects, and tonsillar Tfh from HIV-uninfected subjects were isolated by cell sorting prior to cell surface and molecular characterization. HIV proviral gp120 sequences were submitted to genotypic and phenotypic tropism assays. Entry of CCR5- and CXCR4-using viruses into Tfh from uninfected tonsillar tissue was measured using a fusion assay. Phylogenetic analysis, genotypic, and phenotypic analysis showed that splenic Tfh cells from chronic HIV<sup>+</sup> subjects were predominantly infected with CCR5-using viruses. In macaques, purified CCR5<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>intermediate(int)+</sup> memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were shown to include pre-Tfh cells capable of differentiating <i>in vitro</i> to Tfh by upregulation of PD-1 and Bcl6, confirmed by qRT-PCR and single-cell multiplex PCR. Infected PD-1<sup>int</sup> cells survive, carry SIV provirus, and differentiate into PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Tfh after T cell receptor stimulation, suggesting a pathway for SIV infection of Tfh. In addition, a small subset of macaque and human PD-1<sup>hi</sup> Tfh can express low levels of CCR5, which makes them susceptible to infection. Fusion assays demonstrated CCR5-using HIV-1 entry into CCR5<sup>+</sup> Tfh and pre-Tfh cells from human tonsils. The major route of infection of Tfh in macaques and humans appears to be <i>via</i> a CCR5-expressing pre-Tfh population. As the generation of Tfh are important for establishing effective immune responses during primary infections, Tfh are likely to be an early target of HIV-1 following transmission, creating an important component of the reservoir that has the potential to expand over time.\",\"The association between emergence of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 variants (X4 variants) and disease progression of HIV-1 infection has been reported. However, it is not known whether the emergence of X4 variants is the cause or result of HIV-1 disease progression. We tried to answer this question. HIV-1 env sequences around the V3 region were analyzed in serially stocked samples in order to determine whether X4 variants emerged before or after the fall in CD4+ T-cell count. The study subjects were five HIV-1-infected hemophiliac slow progressors. Deep sequencing around the HIV-1 env V3 region was conducted in duplicate. Tropism was predicted by geno2pheno [coreceptor] 2.5 with cutoff value of false positive ratio at <5%. When X4 variant was identified in the latest stocked sample before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, we checked viral genotype in previously stocked samples to determine the time of emergence of X4 variants. Emergence of X4 variants was noted in two of the five patients when their CD4+ T-cell counts were still high. The rate of decrease of CD4+ T-cell count or of rise of HIV-1 load accelerated significantly after the emergence of X4 variants in these two cases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these X4 variants emerged from CCR5-tropic HIV-1 viruses with several amino acid changes in the V3 region. The emergence of X4 variants preceded HIV-1 disease progression in two hemophiliac slow progressors.\",\"To evaluate the mutational patterns on the pol gene of the main HIV-1 strain archived in cell genome of 10 chronically infected men according to their clinical and therapeutic history. The genotyping resistance profiles were compared between the first blood plasma available at the time of HIV diagnosis and rectal biopsies and PBMC sampled 1-5 years after the initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV-1 RNA and cell-associated HIV-1 DNA were quantified by Abbott Real-Time HIV-1 and Generic HIV\\u00ae DNA cell (Biocentric) assays. The mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase genes were assessed by the Trugene\\u00ae assay (Siemens). The C2V3 region was amplified to determine the viral tropism. In 9 patients, slight or no differences were observed between the 3 resistance profiles. Those mostly detected were related to the resistance to nucleos(t)ide (D67N, L210W, T215A, T69D) and nonnucleoside (K103N, V106I, V179I) inhibitors. In 1 rilpivirine-treated patient, the M230I mutation was detected in PBMC. No change of viral tropism was observed between samples. These data suggest that resistance mutations harbored by the main HIV strain in plasma at the time of diagnosis are durably archived in DNA cells whatever the delay between infection and initiation of therapy in patients well controlled by cART.\",\"Lentiviruses are suitable to transfer potential therapeutic genes into non-replicating cells such as neurons, but systematic in vivo studies on transduction of neural cells within the complete brain are missing. We analysed the distribution of transduced cells with respect to brain structure, virus tropism, numbers of transduced neurons per brain, and influence of the Vpx or Vpr accessory proteins after injection of vectors based on SIVsmmPBj, HIV-2, and HIV-1 lentiviruses into the right striatum of the mouse brain. Transduced cells were found ipsilaterally around the injection canal, in corpus striatum and along corpus callosum, irrespective of the vector type. All vectors except HIV-2SEW transduced also single cells in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Vector HIV-2SEW was the most neuron specific. However, vectors PBjSEW and HIV-1SEW transduced more neurons per brain (means 41,299 and 32,309) than HIV-2SEW (16,102). In the presence of Vpx/Vpr proteins, HIV-2SEW(Vpx) and HIV-1SEW(Vpr) showed higher overall transduction efficiencies (30,696 and 27,947 neurons per brain) than PBjSEW(Vpx) (6636). The distances of transduced cells from the injection canal did not differ among the viruses but correlated positively with the numbers of transduced neurons. The presence of Vpx/Vpr did not increase the numbers of transduced neurons. Parental virus type and the vector equipment seem to influence cellular tropism and transduction efficiency. Thus, precision of injection and choice of virus pseudotype are not sufficient when targeted lentiviral vector transduction of a defined brain cell population is required.\",\"A hallmark of HIV-1 infection is the continuously declining number of the virus' predominant target cells, activated CD4+ T cells. With diminishing CD4+ T cell levels, the capacity to utilize alternate cell types and receptors, including cells that express low CD4 receptor levels such as macrophages, thus becomes crucial. To explore evolutionary paths that allow HIV-1 to acquire a wider host cell range by infecting cells with lower CD4 levels, we dissected the evolution of the envelope-CD4 interaction under in vitro culture conditions that mimicked the decline of CD4high target cells, using a prototypic subtype B, R5-tropic strain. Adaptation to CD4low targets proved to severely alter envelope functions including trimer opening as indicated by a higher affinity to CD4 and loss in shielding against neutralizing antibodies. We observed a strikingly decreased infectivity on CD4high target cells, but sustained infectivity on CD4low targets, including macrophages. Intriguingly, the adaptation to CD4low targets altered the kinetic of the entry process, leading to rapid CD4 engagement and an extended transition time between CD4 and CCR5 binding during entry. This phenotype was also observed for certain central nervous system (CNS) derived macrophage-tropic viruses, highlighting that the functional perturbation we defined upon in vitro adaptation to CD4low targets occurs in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that CD4low adapted envelopes may exhibit severe deficiencies in entry fitness and shielding early in their evolution. Considering this, adaptation to CD4low targets may preferentially occur in a sheltered and immune-privileged environment such as the CNS to allow fitness restoring compensatory mutations to occur.\",\"The coreceptor used by HIV-1 must be determined before a CCR5 antagonist, part of the arsenal of antiretroviral drugs, is prescribed because viruses that enter cells using the CXCR4 coreceptor are responsible for treatment failure. HIV-1 tropism is also correlated with disease progression and so must be determined for virological studies. Tropism can be determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS), but not all of these new technologies have been fully validated for use in clinical practice. The Illumina NGS technology is used in many laboratories but its ability to predict HIV-1 tropism has not been evaluated while the 454 GS-Junior (Roche) is used for routine diagnosis. The genotypic prediction of HIV-1 tropism is based on sequencing the V3 region and interpreting the results with an appropriate algorithm. We compared the performances of the MiSeq (Illumina) and 454 GS-Junior (Roche) systems with a reference phenotypic assay. We used clinical samples for the NGS tropism predictions and assessed their ability to quantify CXCR4-using variants. The data show that the Illumina platform can be used to detect minor CXCR4-using variants in clinical practice but technical optimization are needed to improve quantification.\",\"Lentiviral vectors are gene delivery vehicles that integrate into the host genome of dividing and non-dividing mammalian cells facilitating long-term transgene expression. Lentiviral vector versatility is greatly increased by incorporating heterologous viral envelope proteins onto the vector particles instead of the native envelope, conferring on these pseudotyped vectors a modified tropism and host range specificity. We investigated the pseudotyping efficiency of HIV-1 based lentiviral vectors with alphaviral envelope proteins from the Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV-G) and Sindbis Virus (SINV-G). Following vector production optimisation, titres for the CHIKV-G pseudotype were comparable to the VSV-G pseudotype but those for the SINV-G pseudotype were significantly lower. High titre CHIKV-G pseudotyped vector efficiently transduced various human and mouse neural cell lines and normal human astrocytes (NHA) in\\u00a0vitro. Although transduction was broad, tropism for NHAs was observed. In\\u00a0vivo stereotaxic delivery in striatum, thalamus and hippocampus respectively in the adult rat brain revealed localised transduction restricted to striatal astrocytes and hippocampal dentate granule neurons. Transduction of different subtypes of granule neurons from precursor to post-mitotic stages of differentiation was evident in the sub-granular zone and dentate granule cell layer. No significant inflammatory response was observed, but comparable to that of VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. Robust long-term expression followed for three months post-transduction along with absence of neuroinflammation, coupled to the selective and unique neuron/glial tropism indicates that these vectors could be useful for modelling and gene therapy studies in the CNS.\",\"To investigate if plasma HIV-1 tropism testing could identify subjects at higher risk for clinical progression and death in routine clinical management. Nested case-control study within the EuroSIDA cohort. Cases were subjects with AIDS or who died from any cause, with a plasma sample with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/mL available for tropism testing 3 to 12 months prior to the event. At least 1 control matched for age, HIV-1 RNA and HCV status at the time of sampling were selected per each case. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate exposures associated with clinical progression to AIDS or death. A linear mixed model with random intercept was used to compare CD4+T-cell slopes by HIV tropism over the 12 months following the date of sampling. The study included 266 subjects, 100 cases and 166 controls; one quarter had X4 HIV; 26% were ART-na\\u00efve. Baseline factors independently associated with clinical progression or death were female gender (OR = 2.13 vs. male, 95CI = 1.04, 4.36), p = 0.038), CD4+T-cell count (OR = 0.90 (95CI = 0.80, 1.00) per 100 cells/mm3 higher, p = 0.058), being on ART (OR = 2.72 vs. being off-ART (95CI = 1.15, 6.41), p = 0.022) and calendar year of sample [OR = 0.84 (95CI = 0.77, 0.91) per more recent year, p<0.001). Baseline tropism was not associated with the risk of clinical progression or death. CD4+T-cell slopes did not differ within or between tropism groups. The predictive role of plasma tropism determined using 454 sequencing in the context of people receiving cART with detectable VL is not helpful to identify subjects at higher risk for clinical progression to AIDS or death.\",\"HIV type-1 (HIV-1) causes a spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) complications; many are worsened by opiate co-exposure. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) give rise to all CNS neurons and macroglia. We tested the hypothesis that hNPC maturation and fate are altered by HIV and opiates, contributing to HIV-1-related neuropathology. Reports of hNPC infection remain controversial. We rigorously examined this question, testing whether hNPCs propogated infection, and whether HIV affected hNPCs absent their infection. Primary hNPCs were characterized over multiple passages. Following R5 HIV-1BaL exposure, p24, Nef, and tat assays monitored infection; a serial dilution approach tested infection transfer to naive hNPCs. Bromodeoxyuridine uptake, population doubling time, and immunostaining assessed proliferation and differentiation. Morphine co-exposure assessed opiate interactions. Supernatant from HIV-1BaL-infected PBMCs (HIVsup), HIV-1BaL, and ultraviolet light-inactivated HIVsup were compared to test effects of inflammatory milieu versus virus or infection per se. The hNPCs (CD4/CD8/Iba/CXC3CL1/CD11b) were infectable and could transfer infection to naive hNPCs. Infection was partly blocked by maraviroc, implicating CCR5. HIVsup reduced hNPC proliferation and caused premature differentiation into neurons/astroglia. Effects on proliferation were due to soluble factors/viral proteins, not infection per se. Morphine co-exposure exacerbated certain functional consequences of HIVsup, and sustained the infection of hNPCs. hNPCs can be infected and propagate virus in vitro. hNPCs or their progeny may represent an underappreciated viral reservoir. Factors from infected cells alter hNPC proliferation and neural cell maturation, which likely compromises CNS structure and function. Morphine-HIV interactions may worsen dysfunction and sustain infection.\",\"CCR5 coreceptor using HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) has been reported to dominate the Ethiopian epidemic. However, almost all data have been obtained from two large cities in the central and north-west regions and recent data is lacking. Plasma were obtained from 420 treatment-na\\u00efve patients recruited 2009-2011 to a large country-wide Ethiopian cohort. The V3 region was sequenced and the co-receptor tropism was predicted by the clinical and clonal models of the geno2pheno tool at different false positive rates (fpr) and for subtype. In an intention to treat analysis the impact of baseline tropism on outcome of antiretroviral therapy was evaluated. V3 loop sequencing was successful in 352 (84%) patients. HIV-1C was found in 350 (99.4%) and HIV-1A in two (0.6%) patients. When comparing the geno2pheno fpr10% clonal and clinical models, 24.4% predictions were discordant. X4-virus was predicted in 17.0 and 19.0%, respectively, but the predictions were concordant in only 6%. At fpr5%, concordant X4-virus predictions were obtained in 3.1%. The proportion of X4-tropic virus (clonal fpr10%) increased from 5.6 to 17.3% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) when 387 Ethiopian V3 loop sequences dated from 1984 to 2003 were compared with ours. In an intention to treat analysis, 67.9% reached treatment success at month 6 and only 50% at month 12. Only age and not tropism predicted therapy outcome and no difference was found in CD4+ cell gain between R5-tropic and X4-tropic infected patients. At viral failure, R5 to X4 switch was rare while X4 to R5 switch occurred more frequently (month 6: p\\u2009=\\u20090.006; month 12: p\\u2009=\\u20090.078). The HIV-1C epidemic is monophylogenetic in all regions of Ethiopia and R5-tropic virus dominates, even in patients with advanced immunodeficiency, although the proportion of X4-tropic virus seems to have increased over the last two decades. Geno2pheno clinical and clonal prediction models show a large discrepancy at fpr10%, but not at fpr5%. Hence further studies are needed to assess the utility of genotypic tropism testing in HIV-1C. In ITT analysis only age and not tropism influenced the outcome.\",\"Worldwide most HIV infections occur through heterosexual transmission, involving complex interactions of cell-free and cell-associated particles with cells of the female genital tract mucosa. The ability of HIV-1 to \\\"infect\\\" epithelial cells remains poorly understood. To address this question, replicative-competent chimeric constructs expressing fluorescent proteins and harboring the envelope of X4- or R5-tropic HIV-1 strains were used to \\\"infect\\\" endometrial HEC1-A cells. The virus-cell interactions were visualized using confocal microscopy (CM) at various times post infection. Combined with quantification of viral RNA and total HIV DNA in infected cells, the CM pictures suggest that epithelial cells do not support a complete viral replication cycle: X4-tropic viruses are imported into the nucleus in a non-productive way, whereas R5-tropic viruses transit through the cytoplasm without replication and are preferentially transmitted to susceptible activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Within the limit of experiments conducted in vitro on a continued cell line, these results indicate that the epithelial mucosa may participate to the selection of HIV-1 strains at the mucosal level.\",\"Scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the growing number of long-term treated patients may favor multi-HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in resource-limited settings. Understanding the burden of HIVDR with ART-exposure may provide new insights for an effective long-term management of infected patients. Sixty-six HIV-infected individuals (18 ART-na\\u00efve, 24 failing first-line, 24 failing second-line ART) living in Yaound\\u00e9-Cameroon were evaluated by sequencing protease-reverse transcriptase (PR-RT, n=62), envelope-V3 loop (V3, n=58) and integrase (IN, n=30) regions. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using Stanford University HIV drug resistance database and geno2pheno, while viral tropism prediction was done using geno2pheno, position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) and Net charge rule. Participants, from na\\u00efve, first- to second-line, had respectively 5.30, 4.85 and 4.66 log HIV RNA, and 532, 203 and 146 CD4 cells/mm3), and infected with diverse HIV-1 non-B clades (58.1% CRF02_AG). Among ART-na\\u00efve patients, 6.7% harbored K103N, 28.6% had IN accessory-mutations (L74I, E157Q) and 26.7% carried CXCR4-tropic viruses. At first-line failure, 79.2% harbored DRMs to nucleoside and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors, 33.3% had IN accessory-mutations (L68I, L74I, T97A, E157Q), and 47.4% carried CXCR4-tropic viruses. At second-line failure, 91.3% harbored multi-DRMs to PR-RT inhibitors (with 52.2% and 4.3% DRMs to second-generation NNRTIs and darunavir/r, respectively), 27.3% had IN accessory-mutations (L74I, T97A, E157EQ), and 37.5% carried CXCR4-tropic viruses. Levels of PR-RT resistance increases with ART-exposure, with needs for new ART-options following second-line failure. IN inhibitors and darunavir/r are potentially suitable for a third-line regimen, while the use of maraviroc, etravirine or rilpivirine, requires individual genotypic testing.\",\"African green monkeys (AGM) and sooty mangabeys (SM) are well-studied natural hosts of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that do not progress to AIDS when infected with their species-specific viruses. Natural hosts of SIV express very low levels of the canonical entry coreceptor CCR5, and recent studies have shown that CCR5 is dispensable for SIV infection of SM in vivo and that blocking of CCR5 does not prevent ex vivo infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SM or vervet AGM. In both hosts, CXCR6 is an efficient entry pathway in vitro Here we investigated the use of species-matched CXCR6 and other alternative coreceptors by SIVagmSab, which infects sabaeus AGM. We cloned sabaeus CD4 and 10 candidate coreceptors. Species-matched CXCR6, CCR5, and GPR15 mediated robust entry into transfected cells by pseudotypes carrying SIVagmSab92018ivTF Env, with lower-level entry through GPR1 and APJ. We cloned genetically divergent env genes from the plasma of two wild-infected sabaeus AGM and found similar patterns of coreceptor use. Titration experiments showed that CXCR6 and CCR5 were more efficient than other coreceptors when tested at limiting CD4/coreceptor levels. Finally, blocking of CXCR6 with its ligand CXCL16 significantly inhibited SIVagmSab replication in sabaeus PBMC and had a greater impact than did the CCR5 blocker maraviroc, confirming the use of CXCR6 in primary lymphocyte infection. These data suggest a new paradigm for SIV infection of natural host species, whereby a shared outcome of virus-host coevolution is the use of CXCR6 or other alternative coreceptors for entry, which may direct SIV toward CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets and anatomical sites that support viral replication without disrupting immune homeostasis and function. Natural hosts of SIV do not progress to AIDS, in stark contrast to pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-human and SIVmac-macaque infections. Identifying how natural hosts avoid immunodeficiency can elucidate key mechanisms of pathogenesis. It is known that despite high viral loads, natural hosts have a low frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells expressing the SIV coreceptor CCR5. In this study, we demonstrate the efficient use of the coreceptor CXCR6 by SIVagmSab to infect sabaeus African green monkey lymphocytes. In conjunction with studies of SIVsmm, which infects sooty mangabeys, and SIVagmVer, which infects vervet monkeys, our data suggest a unifying model whereby in natural hosts, in which the CCR5 expression level is low, the use of CXCR6 or other coreceptors to mediate infection may target SIV toward distinct cell populations that are able to support high-level viral replication without causing a loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell homeostasis and lymphoid tissue damage that lead to AIDS in HIV-1 and SIVmac infections.\",\"Despite success in viral inhibition and CD4 T cell recovery by highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), HIV-1 is still not curable due to the persistence of the HIV-1 reservoir during treatment. One patient with acute myeloid leukemia who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a homozygous CCR5 \\u039432 donor has had no detectable viremia for 9 years after HAART cessation. This case has inspired a field of HIV-1 cure research focusing on engineering HIV-1 resistance in permissive cells. Here, we employed a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-scFv X5 approach to confer resistance of human primary CD4 T cells to HIV-1. We showed that primary CD4 T cells expressing GPI-scFv X5 were resistant to CCR5 (R5)-, CXCR4 (X4)-, and dual-tropic HIV-1 and had a survival advantage compared to control cells ex vivo In a hu-PBL mouse study, GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells were selected in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues upon HIV-1 infection. Finally, GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells, after being cotransfused with HIV-infected cells, showed significantly reduced viral loads and viral RNA copy numbers relative to CD4 cells in hu-PBL mice compared to mice with GPI-scFv AB65-transduced CD4 T cells. We conclude that GPI-scFv X5-modified CD4 T cells could potentially be used as a genetic intervention against both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 infections. Blocking of HIV-1 entry is one of most promising approaches for therapy. Genetic disruption of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 by nucleases in T cells is under 2 clinical trials and leads to reduced viremia in patients. However, the emergence of viruses using the CXCR4 coreceptor is a concern for therapies applying single-coreceptor disruption. Here, we report that HIV-1-permissive CD4 T cells engineered with GPI-scFv X5 are resistant to R5-, X4-, or dual-tropic virus infection ex vivo In a preclinical study using hu-PBL mice, we show that CD4 T cells were protected and that GPI-scFv X5-transduced cells were selected in HIV-1-infected animals. Moreover, we show that GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells exerted a negative effect on virus replication in vivo We conclude that GPI-scFv X5-modified CD4 T cells could potentially be used as a genetic intervention against both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 infections.\",\"HIV-1 entry can be inhibited by soluble peptides from the gp41 heptad repeat-2 (HR2) domain that interfere with formation of the 6-helix bundle during fusion. Inhibition has also been seen when these peptides are conjugated to anchoring molecules and over-expressed on the cell surface. We hypothesized that potent anti-HIV activity could be achieved if a 34 amino acid peptide from HR2 (C34) were brought to the site of virus-cell interactions by conjugation to the amino termini of HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4. C34-conjugated coreceptors were expressed on the surface of T cell lines and primary CD4 T cells, retained the ability to mediate chemotaxis in response to cognate chemokines, and were highly resistant to HIV-1 utilization for entry. Notably, C34-conjugated CCR5 and CXCR4 each exhibited potent and broad inhibition of HIV-1 isolates from diverse clades irrespective of tropism (i.e., each could inhibit R5, X4 and dual-tropic isolates). This inhibition was highly specific and dependent on positioning of the peptide, as HIV-1 infection was poorly inhibited when C34 was conjugated to the amino terminus of CD4. C34-conjugated coreceptors could also inhibit HIV-1 isolates that were resistant to the soluble HR2 peptide inhibitor, enfuvirtide. When introduced into primary cells, CD4 T cells expressing C34-conjugated coreceptors exhibited physiologic responses to T cell activation while inhibiting diverse HIV-1 isolates, and cells containing C34-conjugated CXCR4 expanded during HIV-1 infection in vitro and in a humanized mouse model. Notably, the C34-conjugated peptide exerted greater HIV-1 inhibition when conjugated to CXCR4 than to CCR5. Thus, antiviral effects of HR2 peptides can be specifically directed to the site of viral entry where they provide potent and broad inhibition of HIV-1. This approach to engineer HIV-1 resistance in functional CD4 T cells may provide a novel cell-based therapeutic for controlling HIV infection in humans.\",\"The coreceptor tropism testing should be conducted prior to commencing a regimen containing a CCR5 antagonist for treatment of HIV-1 infection. For aviremic patients on long antiretroviral therapy, proviral DNA is often used instead of viral RNA in genotypic tropism testing. However, the tropism predictions from RNA and DNA are sometimes different. We examined the cause of the discrepancies between HIV-1 tropism predictions based on viral RNA and proviral DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the <i>env</i> C2V3C3 region was determined using pair samples of plasma RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA from 50 HIV-1 subtype B-infected individuals using population-based sequencing. The samples with discrepant tropism assessments between RNA and DNA were further analyzed using deep sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analysis. The tropism was assessed using the algorithm geno2pheno with a false-positive rate cutoff of 10\\u00a0%. In population-based sequencing, five of 50 subjects showed discrepant tropism predictions between their RNA and DNA samples: four exhibited R5 tropism in RNA and X4 tropism in DNA, while one exhibited the opposite pattern. In the deep sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, three subjects had single clusters comprising of RNA- and DNA-derived sequences that were a mixture of R5 and X4 sequences. The other two subjects had two and three distinct phylogenetic clusters of sequences, respectively, each of which was dominated by R5 or X4 sequences; sequences of the R5-dominated cluster were mostly found in RNA, while sequences of the X4-dominated cluster were mostly in DNA. Some of HIV-1 tropism discrepancies between viral RNA and proviral DNA seem to be caused by phylogenetically distinct clusters which resides in plasma and cells in different frequencies. Our findings suggest that the tropism testing using PBMC DNA or deep sequencing may be required when the viral load is not suppressed or rebounds in the course of a CCR5 antagonist-containing regimen.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1B (HIV-1B) binds to the CD4 receptor and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 to enter T lymphocytes. The amino acid sequence of the HIV envelope glycoprotein V3 region determines the co-receptor tropism, thereby influencing the infectivity of the virus. Our research group previously found that the amino acid at position 22 of the V3 region may affect the infectivity of the virus, and in this study, we tested this hypothesis. We constructed pseudoviruses by changing the amino acids at position 22 of the V3 region in CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic viruses and tested their infectivity. When the amino acid at V3 position 22 was altered in the CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, their ability to infect cells decreased to 20.6% and 17.14%, respectively. Therefore, we propose that residue 22 in the V3 region of subtype HIV-1B significantly influences the infectivity of the virus.\",\"New genetic tools are needed to understand the functional interactions between HIV and human host factors in primary cells. We recently developed a method to edit the genome of primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T\\u00a0cells by electroporation of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Here, we adapted this methodology to a high-throughput platform for the efficient, arrayed editing of candidate host factors. CXCR4 or CCR5 knockout cells generated with this method are resistant to HIV infection in a tropism-dependent manner, whereas knockout of LEDGF or TNPO3 results in a tropism-independent reduction in infection. CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs can furthermore edit multiple genes simultaneously, enabling studies of interactions among multiple host and viral factors. Finally, in an arrayed screen of 45 genes associated with HIV integrase, we identified several candidate dependency/restriction factors, demonstrating the power of this approach as a discovery platform. This technology should accelerate target validation for pharmaceutical and cell-based therapies to cure HIV infection.\",\"Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) restrict the entry of diverse enveloped viruses through incompletely understood mechanisms. While IFITMs are reported to inhibit HIV-1, their in\\u00a0vivo relevance is\\u00a0unclear. We show that IFITM sensitivity of HIV-1 strains is determined by the co-receptor usage of the viral envelope glycoproteins as well as IFITM subcellular localization within the target cell. Importantly, we find that transmitted founder HIV-1, which establishes de novo infections, is uniquely resistant to the antiviral activity of IFITMs. However, viral sensitivity to IFITMs, particularly IFITM2 and IFITM3, increases over the first 6\\u00a0months of infection, primarily as a result of neutralizing antibody escape mutations. Additionally, the ability to evade IFITM restriction contributes to the different interferon sensitivities of transmitted founder and chronic viruses. Together, these data indicate that IFITMs constitute an important barrier to HIV-1 transmission and that escape from adaptive immune responses exposes the virus to antiviral restriction.\",\"Coreceptor switching from CCR5 to CXCR4 is common during chronic HIV-1 infection, but is even more common in individuals who have failed antiretroviral therapy (ART). Prior studies have suggested rapid mutation and/or recombination of HIV-1 envelope (env) genes during coreceptor switching. We compared the functional and genotypic changes in env of viruses from viremic subjects who had failed ART just before and after coreceptor switching and compared those to viruses from matched subjects without coreceptor switching. Analysis of multiple unique functional env clones from each subject revealed extensive diversity at both sample time points and rapid diversification of sequences during the 4-month interval in viruses from both 9 subjects with coreceptor switching and 15 control subjects. Only two subjects had envs with evidence of recombination. Three findings distinguished env clones from subjects with coreceptor switching from controls: (1) lower entry efficiency via CCR5; (2) longer V1/V2 regions; and (3), lower nadir CD4\\u2009T cell counts during prior years of infection. Most of these subjects harbored virus with lower replicative capacity associated with protease (PR) and/or reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations, and the extensive diversification tended to lead either to improved entry efficiency via CCR5 or the gain of entry function via CXCR4. These results suggest that R5X4 or X4 variants emerge from a diverse, low-fitness landscape shaped by chronic infection, multiple ART resistance mutations, the availability of target cells, and reduced entry efficiency via CCR5.\",\"Mucosal HIV-1 transmission predominantly results in a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus establishing infection in the new host despite the generally high genetic diversity of the transmitter virus population. To what extent HIV-1 transmission is a stochastic process or driven by selective forces that allow T/F viruses best to overcome bottlenecks in transmission has not been conclusively resolved. Building on prior investigations that suggest HIV-1 envelope (Env) features to contribute in the selection process during transmission, we compared phenotypic virus characteristics of nine HIV-1 subtype B transmission pairs, six men who have sex with men and three male-to-female transmission pairs. All recipients were identified early in acute infection and harbored based on extensive sequencing analysis a single T/F virus allowing a controlled analysis of virus properties in matched transmission pairs. Recipient and transmitter viruses from the closest time point to transmission showed no signs of selection for specific Env modifications such as variable loop length and glycosylation. Recipient viruses were resistant to circulating plasma antibodies of the transmitter and also showed no altered sensitivity to a large panel of entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies. The recipient virus did not consistently differ from the transmitter virus in terms of entry kinetics, cell-cell transmission and replicative capacity in primary cells. Our paired analysis revealed a higher sensitivity of several recipient virus isolates to interferon-\\u03b1 (IFN\\u03b1) which suggests that resistance to IFN\\u03b1 cannot be a general driving force in T/F establishment. With the exception of increased IFN\\u03b1 sensitivity, none of the phenotypic virus properties we investigated clearly distinguished T/F viruses from their matched transmitter viruses supporting the notion that at least in subtype B infection HIV-1 transmission is to a considerable extent stochastic.\",\"We defined the effects of the cytoplasmic domain (CT) of the Env glycoprotein on co-receptor usage of HIV-1 by reciprocal exchanges of regions containing V3-V5 loops between CD4-dependent and CD4-independent isolates. Primary HIV-1 isolate Env clones CD8 CXCR4-tropic 92UG046 CT84 with an 84-aa truncated CT domain, CD4 CXCR4-tropic 92UG046, and CD4 CCR5-tropic SF162 with full-length (FL) CT domains were used for comparison. The parental 92UG046 Env with CT84 was not fusogenic, but a chimeric SF162 V3-V5-CT84 with an 84-aa truncated CT domain, which demonstrated a switched co-receptor specificity, exhibited syncytium-formation activity with 3T3T4X4 cells. The wild-type (WT) SF162 Env with CT84 or full-length CT was fusogenic in 3T3T4R5 cells. By exchange of V3-V5 loops, we were able to alter WT SF162 to switch its co-receptor preference, which was not dependent on CT domain length. These results provide evidence that CT domains can induce conformational changes in functional regions of gp120 and determine receptor tropism but do not modulate HIV-1 co-receptor specificity. \",\"In most patients, current antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens can rapidly reduce plasma viral load. However, even after years of effective treatment, a significant proportion of patients show residual plasma viremia below the clinical detection limit. Although residual viremia might be associated with increased chronic immune activation and morbidity, its origin and its potential role in the replenishment of the viral reservoir during suppressive ART is not completely understood. We performed an in-depth genetic analysis of the total and episomal cell-associated viral DNA (vDNA) repertoire in purified CD4(+) T cell subsets of three HIV-infected individuals, and used phylogenetic analysis to explore its relationship with plasma viruses. The predominant proviral reservoir was established in na\\u00efve or memory (central and transitional) CD4(+) T cell subsets in patients harboring X4- or R5-tropic viruses, respectively. Regardless of the viral tropism, most plasma viruses detected under suppressive ART resembled the proviral reservoir identified in effector and transitional memory CD4(+) T-cell subsets in blood, suggesting that residual viremia originates from these cells in either blood or lymphoid tissue. Most importantly, sequences in episomal vDNA in CD4(+) T-cells were not well represented in residual viremia. Viral tropism determines the differential distribution of viral reservoir among CD4(+) T-cell subsets. In spite of viral tropism, the effector and transitional memory CD4(+) T-cells subsets are the main source of residual viremia during suppressive ART, even though their contribution to the total proviral pool is small. However, the lack of concordance between residual viremia and viral variants driving de novo infection of CD4(+) T cells on ART may reflect the predominance of defective plasma HIV RNA genomes. These findings highlight the need for monitoring the multiple viral RNA/DNA persistence markers, based on their differential contribution to viral persistence.\",\"HIV has a very limited species tropism that prevents the use of most conventional small animal models for AIDS research. The in vivo analysis of HIV/AIDS has benefited extensively from novel chimeric animal models that accurately recapitulate key aspects of the human condition. Specifically, immunodeficient mice that are systemically repopulated with human hematolymphoid cells offer a viable alternative for the study of a multitude of highly relevant aspects of HIV replication, pathogenesis, therapy, transmission, prevention, and eradication. This article summarizes some of the multiple contributions that humanized mouse models of HIV infection have made to the field of AIDS research. These models have proven to be highly informative and hold great potential for accelerating multiple aspects of HIV research in the future.\",\"We assessed the virological efficacy of a 6 month maraviroc/raltegravir simplification strategy following 6 months of quadruple therapy combining tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine with maraviroc/raltegravir. HIV-1-infected naive patients were enrolled in an open label, single-arm, Phase 2 trial. All patients received maraviroc 300 mg twice daily, raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and tenofovir/emtricitabine for 24 weeks. Patients with stable HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL stopped tenofovir/emtricitabine at week (W) 24 and pursued maraviroc/raltegravir until W48. The primary endpoint was the virological response defined by HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL at W48. Thirty-three patients were analysed. Patients were mostly male (94%), Caucasians (91%), MSM (82%); their median age was 42 years. At baseline, median CD4 cell count was 453 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and HIV-RNA was 4.3 log copies/mL. All patients had CCR5-tropic viruses by genotropism and phenotropism assays. All but one patient had an HIV-RNA <\\u200a50 copies/mL at W24 and entered the simplification phase. Virological success was maintained at W48 in 88% (90% CI 79%-97%) of patients. N155H mutation was detected at failure in one patient. No tropism switch was observed. Raltegravir and maraviroc plasma exposure were satisfactory in 92% and 79% of 41 samples from 21 patients. Five severe adverse events (SAEs) were observed up to W48; none was related to the study drugs. Four patients presented grade 3 AEs; none was related to the study. No grade 4 AE was observed. No patient died. Maraviroc/raltegravir maintenance therapy following a 6 month induction phase with maraviroc/raltegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine was well tolerated and maintained virological efficacy in these carefully selected patients.\",\"Although both C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)- and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using HIV-1 strains cause AIDS, the emergence of CXCR4-utilizing variants is associated with an accelerated decline in CD4+ T cells. It remains uncertain if CXCR4-using viruses hasten disease or if these variants only emerge after profound immunological damage. We show that exclusively CXCR4- as compared to cocirculating CCR5-utilizing variants are less sensitive to neutralization by both contemporaneous autologous plasma and plasma pools from individuals that harbor only CCR5-using HIV-1. The CXCR4-utilizing variants, however, do not have a global antigenic change because they remain equivalently susceptible to antibodies that do not target coreceptor binding domains. Studies with envelope V3 loop directed antibodies and chimeric envelopes suggest that the neutralization susceptibility differences are potentially influenced by the V3 loop. In vitro passage of a neutralization sensitive CCR5-using virus in the presence of autologous plasma and activated CD4+ T cells led to the emergence of a CXCR4-utilizing virus in 1 of 3 cases. These results suggest that in some but not necessarily all HIV-1 infected individuals humoral immune pressure against the autologous virus selects for CXCR4-using variants, which potentially accelerates disease progression. Our observations have implications for using antibodies for HIV-1 immune therapy. \",\"In the last three decades, extensive research on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has highlighted its capability to exploit a variety of strategies to enter and infect immune cells. Although CD4(+) T cells are well known as the major HIV target, with infection occurring through the canonical combination of the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) receptor and either the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) coreceptors, HIV has also been found to enter other important immune cell types such as macrophages, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, B cells, and granulocytes. Interestingly, the expression of distinct cellular cofactors partially regulates the rate in which HIV infects each distinct cell type. Furthermore, HIV can benefit from the acquisition of new proteins incorporated into its envelope during budding events. While several publications have investigated details of how HIV manipulates particular cell types or subtypes, an up-to-date comprehensive review on HIV tropism for different immune cells is lacking. Therefore, this review is meant to focus on the different receptors, coreceptors, and cofactors that HIV exploits to enter particular immune cells. Additionally, prophylactic approaches that have targeted particular molecules associated with HIV entry and infection of different immune cells will be discussed. Unveiling the underlying cellular receptors and cofactors that lead to HIV preference for specific immune cell populations is crucial in identifying novel preventative/therapeutic targets for comprehensive strategies to eliminate viral infection.\",\"HIV Elite Controllers may reveal insights into virus persistence given they harbour small reservoir sizes, akin to HIV non-controllers treated early with combination antiretroviral therapy. Both groups of patients represent the most promising candidates for interventions aimed at sustained remission or 'cure'. Analytic treatment interruption (ATI) in the latter group leads to stochastic rebound of virus, though it is unclear whether loss of elite control is also associated with similar rebound characteristics. We studied three discrete periods of virus rebound during myeloma related immune disruption over 2.5 years in an elite controller who previously underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the absence of any antiretroviral therapy. Single genome sequencing of the V1-V4 region of env in PBMC and plasma was performed and phylogenies reconstructed. Average pairwise distance (APD) was calculated and non-parametric methods used to assess compartmentalisation. Coreceptor usage was predicted based on genotypic algorithms. 122 single genome sequences were obtained (median 26 sequences per rebound). The initial rebounding plasma env sequences following ASCT represented two distinct lineages, and clustered with proviral DNA sequences isolated prior to ASCT. One of the lineages was monophyletic, possibly indicating reactivation from clonally expanded cells. The second rebound occurred 470 days after spontaneous control of the first rebound and was phylogenetically distinct from the first, confirmed by compartmentalisation analysis, with a different cellular origin rather than ongoing replication. By contrast, third rebound viruses clustered with second rebound viruses, with evidence for ongoing evolution that was associated with lymphopenia and myeloma progression. Following ASCT a shift in tropism from CXCR4-tropic viruses to a CCR5-tropic population was observed to persist through to the third rebound. Our data highlight similarities in the viral reservoir between elite and non-controllers undergoing ATI following allogeneic transplantation. The lack of propagation of CXCR4 using viruses following transplantation warrants further study.\",\"The origins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been widely accepted to be the consequences of simian immunodeficiency viruses from wild chimpanzees (SIVcpz) crossing over to humans. However, there has not been any in vivo study of SIVcpz infection of humans. Also, it remains largely unknown why only specific SIVcpz strains have achieved cross-species transmission and what transmission risk might exist for those SIVcpz strains that have not been found to infect humans. Closing this knowledge gap is essential for better understanding cross-species transmission and predicting the likelihood of additional cross-species transmissions of SIV into humans. Here we show that humanized bone marrow, thymus, and liver (hu-BLT) mice are susceptible to all studied strains of SIVcpz, including the inferred ancestral viruses of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 groups M (SIVcpzMB897) and N (SIVcpzEK505) as well as strains that have not been found in humans (SIVcpzMT145 and SIVcpzBF1167). Importantly, the ability of SIVcpz to cross the interspecies barrier to infect humanized mice correlates with their phylogenetic distance to pandemic HIV-1. We also identified mutations of SIVcpzMB897 (Env G411R and G413R) and SIVcpzBF1167 (Env H280Q and Q380R) at 14 weeks postinoculation. Together, our results have recapitulated the events of SIVcpz cross-species transmission to humans and identified mutations that occurred during the first 16 weeks of infection, providing in vivo experimental evidence that the origins of HIV-1 are the consequence of SIVcpz crossing over to humans. This study also revealed that SIVcpz viruses whose inferred descendants have not been found in humans still have the potential to cause an HIV-1-like zoonosis. It is believed that the origins of HIV-1 are the consequence of SIV from wild chimpanzees crossing over to humans. However, the origins of HIV-1 have been linked back to only specific SIVcpz strains. There have been no experiments that directly test the in vivo cross-species transmissibility of SIVcpz strains to humans. This is the first in vivo study of SIVcpz cross-species transmission. With the humanized-BLT mouse model, we have provided in vivo experimental evidence of multiple SIVcpz strains crossing over to humans and identified several important mutations of divergent SIVcpz strains after long-term replication in human cells. We also found that the cross-species transmission barrier of SIVcpz to humans correlates with their phylogenetic distance to pandemic HIV-1 group M. Importantly, this work provides evidence that SIVcpz viruses, whose inferred descendants have not been found in humans, still have the potential to cause a future HIV-1-like zoonotic outbreak.\",\"HIV-1 infection is enhanced by adhesive structures that form between infected and uninfected T\\u00a0cells called virological synapses (VSs). This mode of transmission results in the frequent co-transmission of multiple copies of HIV-1 across the VS, which can reduce sensitivity to antiretroviral drugs. Studying HIV-1 infection of humanized mice, we measured the frequency of co-transmission and the spatiotemporal organization of infected cells as indicators of cell-to-cell transmission in\\u00a0vivo. When inoculating mice with cells co-infected with two viral genotypes, we observed high levels of co-transmission to target cells. Additionally, micro-anatomical clustering of viral genotypes within lymphoid tissue indicates that viral spread is driven by local processes and not a diffuse viral cloud. Intravital splenic imaging reveals that anchored HIV-infected cells induce arrest of interacting, uninfected CD4(+) T\\u00a0cells to form Env-dependent cell-cell conjugates. These findings suggest that HIV-1 spread between immune cells can be anatomically localized into infectious clusters.\",\"There are few data on clinical and virological factors associated with maraviroc virological response (VR) in clinical practice. This study aimed to identify factors associated with VR in 94 treatment-experienced, but CCR5 inhibitor-naive, HIV-1 patients switched to maraviroc-containing regimens. Patients with HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) <50 copies/mL switching to an antiretroviral treatment containing maraviroc were followed. VR was defined at month 3 as VL <50 copies/mL. The impact of age, baseline tropism, zenith VL, nadir CD4 cell count and CD4 cell count, HIV subtype (B versus non-B), genotypic susceptibility score of treatment, once- or twice-daily treatment and presence of raltegravir in optimized background therapy on VR was investigated. Baseline characteristics were: median age 49 years (range 25-73 years), median CD4 cell count 481 cells/mm(3) (range 57-1830 cells/mm(3)) and median nadir CD4 cell count 99 cells/mm(3) (range 3-585). Maraviroc was administered twice daily in 88 of 94 patients and once daily in 6 of 94 patients (300 mg/day for 4 of 6 and 150 mg/day for 2 of 6). At month 3, 89.4% of patients were responders. A better VR to a switch regimen containing maraviroc was associated with the B subtype (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0216) and a lower zenith VL (median of 5.24 and 5.70 log10 copies/mL for patients in success or in failure, respectively) in univariate analysis. Only B subtype was associated with a better VR in multivariate analysis. This study evidenced the efficacy of a switch regimen containing maraviroc in clinical practice. VR was better for patients with a lower zenith VL and B subtype.\",\"HIV-1 requires the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (CCR5 [R5 phenotype] or CXCR4 [X4 phenotype]) to enter cells. Coreceptor tropism can be assessed by either phenotypic or genotypic analysis, the latter using bioinformatics algorithms to predict tropism based on the env V3 sequence. We used the Primer ID sequencing strategy with the MiSeq sequencing platform to reveal the structure of viral populations in the V1/V2 and C2/V3 regions of the HIV-1 env gene in 30 late-stage and 6 early-stage subjects. We also used endpoint dilution PCR followed by cloning of env genes to create pseudotyped virus to explore the link between genotypic predictions and phenotypic assessment of coreceptor usage. We found out that the most stringently sequence-based calls of X4 variants (Geno2Pheno false-positive rate [FPR] of \\u22642%) formed distinct lineages within the viral population, and these were detected in 24 of 30 late-stage samples (80%), which was significantly higher than what has been seen previously by using other approaches. Non-X4 lineages were not skewed toward lower FPR scores in X4-containing populations. Phenotypic assays showed that variants with an intermediate FPR (2 to 20%) could be either X4/dual-tropic or R5 variants, although the X4 variants made up only about 25% of the lineages with an FPR of <10%, and these variants carried a distinctive sequence change. Phylogenetic analysis of both the V1/V2 and C2/V3 regions showed evidence of recombination within but very little recombination between the X4 and R5 lineages, suggesting that these populations are genetically isolated. Primer ID sequencing provides a novel approach to study genetic structures of viral populations. X4 variants may be more prevalent than previously reported when assessed by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and with a greater depth of sampling than single-genome amplification (SGA). Phylogenetic analysis to identify lineages of sequences with intermediate FPR values may provide additional information for accurately predicting X4 variants by using V3 sequences. Limited recombination occurs between X4 and R5 lineages, suggesting that X4 and R5 variants are genetically isolated and may be replicating in different cell types or that X4/R5 recombinants have reduced fitness.\",\"HTLV type 1 and 2 are both involved in actively spreading epidemics, affecting over 15 million people worldwide. HTLV-1 has been described as the more clinically significant one, being associated with diseases such as adult T-cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis. We report here a case of tropical spastic paraparesis in an HIV-positive patient who did not report any history of travel or residence in an HTLV endemic area. A 57 year old African-American male was admitted to the hospital due to bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness associated with stiffness. He had recently been diagnosed with HIV. His physical examination showed mild to moderate decreased motor strength, in both upper extremities and marked loss in both lower extremities. This was associated with hyperreflexia and clonus. Sensory function was intact. He looked cachectic and had several psoriatic plaques on both lower and upper extremities. Laboratory work-up showed a CD4 count decreased to 94\\u00a0cells/mm(3) and a HIV viral load of 273,000\\u00a0copies/mL. Based on serum positivity for HTLV type 1 and the patient's clinical presentation suggestive of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, the diagnosis of tropical spastic paraparesis was made. HTLV and HIV share the same routes of transmission and the same tropism for T-lymphocytes. Co-infection occurs probably more frequently than we are aware, since testing for HTLV is not routinely performed in outpatient HIV clinics.\",\"HIV-1 entry is a receptor-mediated process directed by the interaction of the viral envelope with the host cell CD4 molecule and one of two co-receptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. The amino acid sequence of the third variable (V3) loop of the HIV-1 envelope is highly predictive of co-receptor utilization preference during entry, and machine learning predictive algorithms have been developed to characterize sequences as CCR5-utilizing (R5) or CXCR4-utilizing (X4). It was hypothesized that while the V3 loop is predominantly responsible for determining co-receptor binding, additional components of the HIV-1 genome may contribute to overall viral tropism and display sequence signatures associated with co-receptor utilization. The accessory protein Tat and the HlV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) were analyzed with respect to genetic diversity and compared by Jensen-Shannon divergence which resulted in a correlation with both mean genetic diversity as well as the absolute difference in genetic diversity between R5- and X4-genome specific trends. As expected, the V3 domain of the gp120 protein was enriched with statistically divergent positions. Statistically divergent positions were also identified in Tat amino acid sequences within the transactivation and TAR-binding domains, and in nucleotide positions throughout the LTR. We further analyzed LTR sequences for putative transcription factor binding sites using the JASPAR transcription factor binding profile database and found several putative differences in transcription factor binding sites between R5 and X4 HIV-1 genomes, specifically identifying the C/EBP sites I and II, and Sp site III to differ with respect to sequence configuration for R5 and X4 LTRs. These observations support the hypothesis that co-receptor utilization coincides with specific genetic signatures in HIV-1 Tat and the LTR, likely due to differing transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and selective pressures applied within specific cellular targets during the course of productive HIV-1 infection.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus-infected people discontinuing therapy experience a rebound in the virus level (hereafter, \\\"rebound virus\\\") from a persistent reservoir. We examined 10 samples from patients in AIDS Clinical Trials Group study A5068 with rebound virus, using single-genome amplification and Primer ID deep sequencing, to assess env genetic diversity of the virus population. Most rebound-virus populations showed significant diversity. All env examined required high levels of CD4 for entry, consistent with selection of replication in CD4(+) T cells. These results indicate that most people discontinuing therapy release a diverse population of virus and that this released virus has entry features of virus selected for replication in CD4(+) T cells, rather than in myeloid cells.\",\"The HIV-1 envelope interacts with coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in a dynamic, multi-step process, its molecular details not clearly delineated. Use of CCR5 antagonists results in tropism shift and therapeutic failure. Here we describe a novel approach using full-length patient-derived gp160 quasispecies libraries cloned into HIV-1 molecular clones, their separation based on phenotypic tropism in vitro, and deep sequencing of the resultant variants for structure-function analyses. Analysis of functionally validated envelope sequences from patients who failed CCR5 antagonist therapy revealed determinants strongly associated with coreceptor specificity, especially at the gp120-gp41 and gp41-gp41 interaction surfaces that invite future research on the roles of subunit interaction and envelope trimer stability in coreceptor usage. This study identifies important structure-function relationships in HIV-1 envelope, and demonstrates proof of concept for a new integrated analysis method that facilitates laboratory discovery of resistant mutants to aid in development of other therapeutic agents.\",\"Previous studies suggest that infection with non-R5-tropic subtype B HIV-1, compared with R5, is associated with a more rapid decline in CD4 cell count, but does not affect PI/(N)NRTI therapy outcome. Here, we explored clinical correlates associated with viral tropism in subtype A1 and D infections. HIV-1 subtype A1 (n\\u200a=\\u200a196) and D (n\\u200a=\\u200a143) pretherapy plasma samples and up to 7.5 years of posttherapy virologic and CD4 data were collected from a cross-sectional cohort in Mbarara, Uganda. Tropism and subtype were inferred using env V3 (geno2pheno) and gp41 (RIP) Sanger sequences. For each subtype, R5 infection was compared with non-R5 in terms of: pretherapy viral load and CD4 cell count (Mann-Whitney tests), and therapy outcomes, including time to virologic suppression, postsuppression virologic rebound, CD4 decline and CD4 recovery (log-rank tests). A 94% of all patients in this study achieved virologic suppression within median 3 months posttherapy. In both subtypes, non-R5 infection was associated with lower pretherapy CD4 cell count (non-R5 vs. R5; A: median 57 vs. 147\\u200acells/\\u03bcl P\\u200a=\\u200a0.005; D: 80 vs. 128\\u200acells/\\u03bcl P\\u200a=\\u200a0.006). Multivariable linear regression confirmed that tropism, not subtype nor the interaction between subtype and tropism, was a significant predictor of pretherapy CD4 cell count (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.0001). None of pretherapy viral load, time to virologic suppression, virologic rebound, CD4 decline nor CD4 recovery was significantly different (all P\\u200a>\\u200a0.09). Regardless of HIV-1 subtype or tropism, the majority of patients in this Ugandan cohort responded to therapy, even though non-R5 infection was associated with lower pretherapy CD4 cell count.\",\"Perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) children and youth are often heavily treatment-experienced, with resultant antiretroviral resistance and limited treatment options. For those with virologic failure (VF), new agents such as CCR5 (R5) antagonists may be useful; however, reports of R5 antagonist susceptibility in children have mostly relied on genotypic testing, which may not accurately reflect the phenotypic tropism of the viral populations. We characterized phenotypic coreceptor usage among PHIV children and youth with VF on antiretroviral treatment to identify predictors of CXCR4 (X4) tropism which preclude R5 antagonist use. Plasma samples with >1000 HIV RNA copies/mL were obtained from 73 PHIV antiretroviral treatment-treated children and youth (age 9-21 years) enrolled in the multicenter Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study. Samples were analyzed using the Trofile phenotypic assay. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with detectable X4 tropism. Tropism results were obtained for 59 (81%) of the 73 children and youth; 32 (54%) had X4-tropism. Persistent viremia (\\u226580% of HIV RNA measurements >400 copies/mL) was associated with detectable X4 tropism (adjusted odds ratio: 6.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 31.4), while longer cumulative nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor use was associated with lower risk of X4 tropism (adjusted odds ratio: 0.6, 95% confidence interval: 0.5, 0.9). Using a phenotypic assay, >50% of PHIV children and youth with VF had X4 tropism, similar to that in experienced adults, and higher than the 30% reported for children using genotypic assays. Persistent viremia and shorter nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor exposure are associated with X4-tropism in children and youth and may help target phenotypic testing to those most likely to benefit from R5 antagonist.\",\"HIV-1 enters immune cells via binding the viral envelope to a host cell CD4 receptor, and then a secondary co-receptor, usually CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4), and some HIV can utilize both co-receptors (R5X4). Although a small set of amino-acid properties such as charge and sequence length applied to HIV-1 envelope V3 loop sequence data can be used to predict co-receptor usage, we sought to expand the fundamental understanding of the physiochemical basis of tropism by analyzing many, perhaps less obvious, amino-acid properties over a diverse array of HIV sequences. We examined 74 amino-acid physicochemical scales over 1,559 V3 loop sequences with biologically tested tropisms downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Linear regressions were then calculated for each feature relative to three tropism transitions (R5\\u2192X4; R5\\u2192R5X4; R5X4\\u2192X4). Independent correlations were rank ordered to determine informative features. A structural analysis of the V3 loop was performed to better interpret these findings relative to HIV tropism states. Similar structural changes are required for R5 and R5X4 to transition to X4, thus suggesting that R5 and R5X4 types are more similar than either phenotype is to X4. Overall, the analysis suggests a continuum of viral tropism that is only partially related to charge; in fact, the analysis suggests that charge modification may be primarily attributed to decreased R5 usage, and further structural changes, particularly those associated with \\u03b2-sheet structure, are likely required for full X4 usage.\",\"Currently, the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus involves combination therapy, as antiretroviral therapy(ART). The treatment has improved steadily since the advent of potent combination therapy in 1996. New drugs that offer new mechanisms of action, improvements in potency and activity even against multidrug-resistant viruses, dosing convenience, and tolerability have been approved. Among ART with useful drugs, there are two important examinations before starting the treatment using the two kinds of drug. CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, maraviroc, prevent HIV entry into target cells by binding to CCR5 receptors. Genotypic assays have been developed that can determine or predict the co-receptor tropism(i.e., CCR5, CXCR4, or both) of the patient's dominant virus population. The assay for HIV-1 co-receptor usage should be performed whenever the use of a CCR5 antagonist is being considered. One of the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), abacavir, is an important agent to develop recommended regimens for antiretroviral therapy. Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir-containing products, ZIAGEN, Epzicom, and Triumeq. Patients who carry the HLA-B*5701 allele are at high-risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, performing a screening test for the HLA-B*5701 allele is recommended. [Review].\",\"A significant percentage of patients infected with HIV-1 experience only suboptimal CD4 cell recovery while treated with combination therapy (cART). It is still unclear whether viral properties such as cell tropism play a major role in this incomplete immune response. This study therefore intended to follow the tropism evolution of the HIV-1 envelope during periods of suppressive cART. Viruses from two distinct patient groups, one with good and another one with poor CD4 recovery after 5 years of suppressive cART, were genotypically analysed for viral tropism at baseline and at the end of the study period. Patients with CCR5-tropic CC-motif chemokine receptor 5 viruses at baseline tended to maintain this tropism to the study end. Patients who had a CXCR4-tropic CXC-motif chemokine receptor 4 virus at baseline were overrepresented in the poor CD4 recovery group. Overall, however, the majority of patients presented with CCR5-tropic viruses at follow-up. Our data lend support to the hypothesis that tropism determination can be used as a parameter for disease progression even if analysed long before the establishment of a poorer immune response. Moreover, the lasting predominating CCR5-tropism during periods of full viral control suggests the involvement of cellular mechanisms that preferentially reduce CXCR4-tropic viruses during cART.\",\"CD4 tropism is conserved among all primate lentiviruses and likely contributes to viral pathogenesis by targeting cells that are critical for adaptive antiviral immune responses. Although CD4-independent variants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have been described that can utilize the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 in the absence of CD4, these viruses typically retain their CD4 binding sites and still can interact with CD4. We describe the derivation of a novel CD4-independent variant of pathogenic SIVmac239, termed iMac239, that was used to derive an infectious R5-tropic SIV lacking a CD4 binding site. Of the seven mutations that differentiate iMac239 from wild-type SIVmac239, a single change (D178G) in the V1/V2 region was sufficient to confer CD4 independence in cell-cell fusion assays, although other mutations were required for replication competence. Like other CD4-independent viruses, iMac239 was highly neutralization sensitive, although mutations were identified that could confer CD4-independent infection without increasing its neutralization sensitivity. Strikingly, iMac239 retained the ability to replicate in cell lines and primary cells even when its CD4 binding site had been ablated by deletion of a highly conserved aspartic acid at position 385, which, for HIV-1, plays a critical role in CD4 binding. iMac239, with and without the D385 deletion, exhibited an expanded host range in primary rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells that included CCR5(+) CD8(+) T cells. As the first non-CD4-tropic SIV, iMac239-\\u0394D385 will afford the opportunity to directly assess the in vivo role of CD4 targeting on pathogenesis and host immune responses. CD4 tropism is an invariant feature of primate lentiviruses and likely plays a key role in pathogenesis by focusing viral infection onto cells that mediate adaptive immune responses and in protecting virions attached to cells from neutralizing antibodies. Although CD4-independent viruses are well described for HIV and SIV, these viruses characteristically retain their CD4 binding site and can engage CD4 if available. We derived a novel CD4-independent, CCR5-tropic variant of the pathogenic molecular clone SIVmac239, termed iMac239. The genetic determinants of iMac239's CD4 independence provide new insights into mechanisms that underlie this phenotype. This virus remained replication competent even after its CD4 binding site had been ablated by mutagenesis. As the first truly non-CD4-tropic SIV, lacking the capacity to interact with CD4, iMac239 will provide the unique opportunity to evaluate SIV pathogenesis and host immune responses in the absence of the immunomodulatory effects of CD4(+) T cell targeting and infection.\",\"As the AIDS pandemic has continued, our understanding of the events that occur during the entry and infection of conventional, susceptible cells has increased dramatically, leading to the development of control therapies for HIV-infected individuals. However, an ongoing hole in our understanding is how HIV crosses the mucosal barriers to gain access to permissive cells, despite how important this information would be in developing successful vaccines and other preventative measures such as topical anti-HIV microbicides. In particular, our knowledge of the role that epithelial cells of the mucosal surfaces play in infection - both during early phases and throughout the life of an infected individual, is currently hazy at best. However, several studies in recent years suggest that HIV can bind to and traverse these mucosal epithelial cells, providing a reservoir of infection that can subsequently infect underlying permissive cells. Despite this interaction with epithelial cells, evidence suggests HIV-1 does not productively infect these cells, although they are capable of transferring surface-bound and transcytosed virus to other, permissive cells. Further, there appear to be key differences between adult and infant epithelial cells in the degree to which HIV can transcytose and infect the epithelium. Thus, it is clear that, whilst not primary targets for infection and virus replication, epithelial cells play an important role in the infection cycle and improving our understanding of their interactions with HIV could potentially provide key insights necessary to develop effective preventative therapies. \",\"The interaction of the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 (gp120/gp41) with coreceptor molecules has important implications for specific cellular targeting and pathogenesis. Experimental and theoretical evidences have shown a role for gp41 in coreceptor tropism, although there is no consensus about the positions involved. Here we analyze the association of physicochemical properties of gp41 amino acid residues with viral tropism (X4, R5, and R5X4) using a large set of HIV-1 sequences. Under the assumption that conserved regions define the complex structural features essential for protein function, we focused our search only on amino acids in the gp41 variable regions. Gp41 amino acid sequences of 2823 HIV-1 strains from all clades with known coreceptor tropism were retrieved from Los Alamos HIV Database. Consensus sequences were constructed for homologous sequences (those obtained from the same patient and having the same tropism) in order to avoid bias due to sequence overrepresentation, and the variability (entropy) per site was determined. Comparisons of hydropathy index (HI) and charge (Q) of amino acid residues at highly variable positions between coreceptor groups were performed using two non-parametrical tests and Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to determine covariance of HI and Q values. Calculation of variability per site rendered 58 highly variable amino acid positions. Of these, statistical analysis rendered significantly different HI or Q only for the R5 vs. R5X4 comparison at twelve positions: 535, 602, 619, 636, 640, 641, 658, 662, 667, 723, 756 and 841. The largest differences in particular amino acid frequencies between coreceptor groups were found at 619, 636, 640, 641, 662, 723 and 756. A hydrophobic tendency of residues 619, 640, 641, 723 and 756, along with a hydrophilic/charged tendency at residues 636 and 662 was observed in R5X4 with respect to R5 sequences. HI of position 640 covariated with that of 602, 619, 636, 662, and 756. Variability and significant correlations of physicochemical properties with viral phenotype suggest that substitutions at residues in the loop (602 and 619), the HR2 (636, 640, 641, 662), and the C-terminal tail (723, 756) of gp41 may contribute to phenotype of R5X4 strains.\",\"A residual mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breastfeeding persists despite prophylaxis. We identified breast milk fatty acids (FA) associated with postnatal HIV transmission through breastfeeding in a case-control study. Cases (n=23) were HIV-infected women with an infant who acquired HIV after 6 weeks of age. Controls (n=23) were matched on infant\\u05f3s age at sample collection. Adjusting for maternal antenatal plasma CD4 T cell count, cis-vaccenic acid (18:1n-7) and eicosatrienoic acid (20:3n-3) were associated with HIV transmission in opposite dose-response manner: OR (tertile 3 versus tertile 1): 10.8 and 0.16, p for trend=0.02 and 0.03, respectively. These fatty acids correlated with HIV RNA load, T helper-1 related cytokines, IL15, IP10, and \\u03b22 microglobulin, positively for cis-vaccenic acid, negatively for eicosatrienoic acid. These results suggested a change in FA synthesis by mammary gland cells leading to increased cis-vaccenic acid in milk of mothers who transmitted HIV to their infant during breastfeeding. \",\"HIV-1 entry into host cells is mediated by interactions between the V3-loop of viral glycoprotein gp120 and chemokine receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, collectively known as HIV-1 coreceptors. Accurate genotypic prediction of coreceptor usage is of significant clinical interest and determination of the factors driving tropism has been the focus of extensive study. We have developed a method based on nonlinear support vector machines to elucidate the interacting residue pairs driving coreceptor usage and provide highly accurate coreceptor usage predictions. Our models utilize centroid-centroid interaction energies from computationally derived structures of the V3-loop:coreceptor complexes as primary features, while additional features based on established rules regarding V3-loop sequences are also investigated. We tested our method on 2455 V3-loop sequences of various lengths and subtypes, and produce a median area under the receiver operator curve of 0.977 based on 500 runs of 10-fold cross validation. Our study is the first to elucidate a small set of specific interacting residue pairs between the V3-loop and coreceptors capable of predicting coreceptor usage with high accuracy across major HIV-1 subtypes. The developed method has been implemented as a web tool named CRUSH, CoReceptor USage prediction for HIV-1, which is available at http://ares.tamu.edu/CRUSH/. \",\"Simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge stocks are critical for preclinical testing of vaccines, antibodies, and other interventions aimed to prevent HIV-1. A major unmet need for the field has been the lack of a SHIV challenge stock expressing circulating recombinant form 01_AE (CRF01_AE) env sequences. We therefore sought to develop mucosally transmissible SHIV challenge stocks containing HIV-1 CRF01_AE env derived from acutely HIV-1 infected individuals from Thailand. SHIV-AE6, SHIV-AE6RM, and SHIV-AE16 contained env sequences that were >99% identical to the original HIV-1 isolate and did not require in vivo passaging. These viruses exhibited CCR5 tropism and displayed a tier 2 neutralization phenotype. These challenge stocks efficiently infected rhesus monkeys by the intrarectal route, replicated to high levels during acute infection, and established chronic viremia in a subset of animals. SHIV-AE16 was titrated for use in single, high dose as well as repetitive, low dose intrarectal challenge studies. These SHIV challenge stocks should facilitate the preclinical evaluation of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and other interventions targeted at preventing HIV-1 CRF01_AE infection. \",\"HIV replication is closely regulated by a complex pathway of host factors, many of them being determinants of cell tropism and host susceptibility to HIV infection. These host factors are known to exert a positive or negative influence on the replication of the two major types of HIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2, thereby modulating virus infectivity, host response to infection and ultimately disease progression profiles characteristic of these two types. Understanding the differential regulation of host cellular factors in response to HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections will help us to understand the apparent differences in rates of disease progression and pathogenesis. This knowledge would aid in the discovery of new biomarkers that may serve as novel targets for therapy and diagnosis. The objective of this study was to determine the differential expression of host genes in response to HIV-1/HIV-2 infection. To achieve this, we analyzed the effects of HIV-1 (MN) and HIV-2 (ROD) infection on the expression of host factors in PBMC at the RNA level using the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray. Differentially expressed genes were identified and their biological functions determined. Host gene expression profiles were significantly changed. Gene expression profiling analysis identified a subset of differentially expressed genes in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cells. Genes involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, immune cell proliferation and activation, cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors were differentially expressed in HIV-1 infected cells. Relatively few genes were differentially expressed in cells infected with HIV-2. \",\"In this paper, we propose and analyze a delayed HIV-1 model with CTL immune response and virus waning. The two discrete delays stand for the time for infected cells to produce viruses after viral entry and for the time for CD8+ T cell immune response to emerge to control viral replication. We obtain the positiveness and boundedness of solutions and find the basic reproduction number R0. If R0 < 1, then the infection-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable and the infection is cleared from the T-cell population; whereas if R0 > 1, then the system is uniformly persistent and the viral concentration maintains at some constant level. The global dynamics when R0 > 1 is complicated. We establish the local stability of the infected steady state and show that Hopf bifurcation can occur. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that if, in the initial infection stage, the effect of delays on HIV-1 infection is ignored, then the risk of HIV-1 infection (if persists) will be underestimated. Moreover, the viral load differs from that without virus waning. These results highlight the important role of delays and virus waning on HIV-1 infection. \",\"Entry of HIV-1 into target cells involves the interaction of the HIV envelope (Env) with both a primary receptor (CD4) and a coreceptor (CXCR4 or CCR5). The relative efficiency with which a particular Env uses these receptors is a major component of cellular tropism in the context of entry and is related to a variety of pathological Env phenotypes (Chikere et al. Virology 435:81-91, 2013). The protocols outlined in this chapter describe the use of the Affinofile system, a 293-based dual-inducible cell line that expresses up to 25 distinct combinations of CD4 and CCR5, as well as the associated Viral Entry Receptor Sensitivity Assay (VERSA) metrics used to summarize the CD4/CCR5-dependent infectivity results. This system allows for high-resolution profiling of CD4 and CCR5 usage efficiency in the context of unique viral phenotypes. \",\"Limited data are available on the durability and effectiveness of maraviroc in routine clinical practice. We assessed the durability of maraviroc-containing regimens during a 30-month period, as well as their immunovirological and clinical efficacy, according to viral tropism in treatment-experienced individuals with viral load (VL) >50 copies/ml in the French Hospital Database on HIV. Virological success was defined as VL<50 copies/ml, immunological success as a confirmed increase of at least 100 CD4 cells/mm3 measured twice at least one month apart, and clinical failure as hospitalization for a non-AIDS event, an AIDS event, or death. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to assess the influence of viral tropism on durability, the immunovirological responses, and clinical outcome. 356 individuals started maraviroc with VL>50 copies/ml of whom 223 harbored R5 viruses, 44 non-R5 viruses and 89 viruses of unknown tropism. Individuals with non-R5 viruses were more likely than individuals with R5 viruses to discontinue maraviroc (75% vs 34%, p<0.0001). At 30 months, the estimated rates of virological and immunological success were respectively 89% and 51% in individuals with R5 viruses and 48% and 23% in individuals with non-R5 viruses. In multivariable analysis, non-R5 viruses were associated with a lower likelihood of both virological success (hazard ratio (HR): 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.25-0.70) and immunological success (HR: 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.77). No difference in clinical outcome was found between individuals with R5 and non-R5 viruses. The effectiveness of maraviroc-containing regimens in individuals with unknown viral tropism was not significantly different from that in individuals with R5 viruses. A limitation of the study is the absence of genotypic susceptibility score. In this observational study, maraviroc-containing regimens yielded high rates of viral suppression and immunological responses in individuals with R5 viruses in whom prior regimens had failed.\",\"Here, we identify ATP1B3 and fibrillin-1 as novel BST-2-binding proteins. ATP1B3 depletion in HeLa cells (BST-2-positive cells), but not 293T cells (BST-2-negative cells), induced the restriction of HIV-1 production in a BST-2-dependent manner. In contrast, fibrillin-1 knockdown reduced HIV-1 production in 293T and HeLa cells in a BST-2-independent manner. Moreover, NF-\\u03baB activation was enhanced by siATP1B3 treatment in HIV-1- and HIV-1\\u0394Vpu-infected HeLa cells. In addition, ATP1B3 silencing induced high level BST-2 expression on the surface of HeLa cells. These results indicate that ATP1B3 is a co-factor that accelerates BST-2 degradation and reduces BST-2-mediated restriction of HIV-1 production and NF-\\u03baB activation. \",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infections have complex effects on adaptive immunity, with specific tropism for, but contrasting effects on, CD4 T lymphocytes: depletion with HIV-1, proliferation with HTLV-1. Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity.\",\"The objective of this study was to address the dynamics of archived resistant quasispecies in cell-associated HIV-1 DNA over time in heavily ART-experienced patients with currently suppressed plasma HIV-1 RNA. Longitudinal ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) analysis of reverse transcriptase, protease and V3 Env regions was performed on blood-cell-associated HIV-1 DNA samples. Drug-resistance-associated mutations (DRAMs) and tropism were interpreted using the ANRS and Geno2Pheno algorithms. We analysed frozen blood cells from patients enrolled in the INNOVE and ANRS 123 ETOILE studies who achieved sustained viral suppression after salvage optimized ART (SOT). Samples were available at baseline and 6 and \\u226512 months after SOT initiation in 10 patients. V3 loop sequences displayed wide intra-individual dynamics over time. Viral variants harbouring DRAMs exhibited three non-exclusive scenarios. First, when SOT exerted the same selective pressure as previous failing regimens, some viral quasispecies still harboured the same DRAMs at the same level as at the time of virological failure. Thus, as DRAMs were mostly associated with the same viral variant, variants with a complete resistance pattern remained archived. Second, some viral variants harbouring DRAMs were no longer detected over time when SOT consisted of new antiretroviral classes or had resistance profiles distinct from those of previous failing regimens. Third, variants with new DRAMs associated with SOT emerged in blood cells during follow-up despite sustained virological control. Using longitudinal UDS analysis and focusing on DRAMs and tropism as markers, we demonstrated that, despite sustained virological control, archived HIV-1 DNA quasispecies continued to evolve.\",\"To compare the efficacy, safety, and anti-inflammatory effects of cenicriviroc (CVC), an oral, once-daily C-C chemokine receptor types 5 and 2 antagonist, with those of efavirenz (EFV) in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected adults. A 48-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy phase 2b trial at 43 institutions (USA and Puerto Rico). Study participants (HIV-1 RNA \\u22651000 copies/ml, CD4 cell count \\u2265200 cells/\\u03bcl, C-C chemokine receptor type 5-tropic virus) were randomized 2\\u200a:\\u200a2\\u200a:\\u200a1 to CVC 100\\u200amg (CVC100), CVC 200\\u200amg (CVC200), or EFV 600\\u200amg, each administered with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Key end points were virologic success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/ml) at week 24 (primary) and week 48 (secondary), safety/tolerability at weeks 24 and 48. Study sites and patients remained blinded until week 48. A total of 143 patients were randomized (CVC100, n\\u200a=\\u200a59; CVC200, n\\u200a=\\u200a56; EFV, n\\u200a=\\u200a28). Virologic success was obtained at week 24 in 76, 73, and 71% of study participants for CVC100, CVC200, and EFV, respectively (all P\\u200a>\\u200a0.05 versus EFV), and at week 48 in 68, 64, and 50%, respectively (all P\\u200a>\\u200a0.05 versus EFV). Resistance mutations emerged in five and zero CVC and EFV-treated study participants, respectively. Virologic nonresponse and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance decreased when CVC minimum plasma concentration was at least 47.8\\u200ang/ml. Treatment-related adverse events of at least grade 2 and discontinuations because of adverse events were less frequent in CVC-treated study participants. Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased with CVC, but increased with EFV. C-C chemokine ligand type 2 (CCL2) (aka monocyte chemotactic protein-1) increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas soluble CD14 levels decreased with CVC. CVC showed efficacy and favorable safety in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected study participants, supporting selection of CVC200 for phase 3 studies. NCT01338883.\",\"We have previously reported the construction of a murine leukemia virus-based replication-competent gammaretrovirus (SL3-AP) capable of utilizing the human G protein-coupled receptor APJ (hAPJ) as its entry receptor and its natural receptor, the murine Xpr1 receptor, with equal affinities. The apelin receptor has previously been shown to function as a coreceptor for HIV-1, and thus, adaptation of the viral vector to this receptor is of significant interest. Here, we report the molecular evolution of the SL3-AP envelope protein when the virus is cultured in cells harboring either the Xpr1 or the hAPJ receptor. Interestingly, the dual receptor affinity is maintained even after 10 passages in these cells. At the same time, the chimeric viral envelope protein evolves in a distinct pattern in the apelin cassette when passaged on D17 cells expressing hAPJ in three separate molecular evolution studies. This pattern reflects selection for reduced ligand-receptor interaction and is compatible with a model in which SL3-AP has evolved not to activate hAPJ receptor internalization. Few successful examples of engineered retargeting of a retroviral vector exist. The engineered SL3-AP envelope is capable of utilizing either the murine Xpr1 or the human APJ receptor for entry. In addition, SL3-AP is the first example of an engineered retrovirus retaining its dual tropism after several rounds of passaging on cells expressing only one of its receptors. We demonstrate that the virus evolves toward reduced ligand-receptor affinity, which sheds new light on virus adaptation. We provide indirect evidence that such reduced affinity leads to reduced receptor internalization and propose a novel model in which too rapid receptor internalization may decrease virus entry.\",\"Available data on the use of maraviroc (MVC) in clinical settings are limited. In this cohort study, the clinical outcomes of HIV-1-infected patients treated with MVC were analysed and the predictive values of different tropism assays were compared. Baseline viral tropism was assessed and compared by phenotypic (Trofile and MT-2) and genotypic assays. Virological and immunological responses were evaluated. In total, 62 predominantly extensively pre-treated patients started MVC [median GSS 2.0 (IQR 2.0-2.5)]. Tropism assays were performed on baseline samples of 58 patients (93.5%). Thirty-two samples (80.0%) were classified as R5 by Trofile, 41 (80.4%) by genotypic tropism test (GTT) and 17 (81.0%) by MT-2. At least two types of tropism assay were performed on samples from 39 patients, whereas in 15 patients all three assays were performed (concordance 84.8-94.1%). Plasma HIV-RNA was <50 copies/mL in 82.1%, 85.0% and 68.8% of patients after 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively; median CD4 cell increase was 199 (IQR 108-283), 291 (IQR 187-413) and 234 (IQR 106-444)cells/\\u03bcL. The predictive values of different tropism assays were comparably high: at Month 24, 92.9% (Trofile and GTT) and 100.0% (MT-2) of patients had plasma HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL. Three patients stopped MVC treatment because of suspected side effects. Five patients died during follow-up. In this heavily pre-treated cohort, treatment with MVC was well tolerated and resulted in good immunological and virological responses. Results generated by the different tropism assays correlated well with each other and had a high predictive value.\",\"Given the multifactorial nature of action of type I interferon (IFN) in HIV-1 infection and the need to firmly establish the action of key components of IFN pathways, we compared the IFN stimulated gene (ISG)15 expression with that of other well-characterized ISGs, evaluating its relationship with immunosuppressive factors regulating T-cell response in HIV-1 patients. PBMC from 225 subjects were included: healthy donors (n=30), na\\u00efve (n=93) and HAART treated HIV-1 subjects (n=102). Levels of ISG15-mRNA, ISG56-mRNA, APOBEC3G/3F-mRNA, TRAIL-mRNA, IDO-mRNA, proviral load andISG15 (rs15842 and rs1921) SNPs were evaluated by using TaqMan assays. We found that ISG15, ISG56, APOBEC3G/3F levels were increased in untreated HIV-1 patients compared to healthy donors, being ISG15 the highest ISG expressed. The amount of ISG15 correlated with viral load and with CD4+ T cell counts whereas no relationship was found between all ISGs analyzed and proviral load or HIV-1 tropism. ISG15 expression was reduced following long-term antiretroviral therapy. In addition, ISG15 levels were correlated with those of TRAIL and IDO in HIV-1 viremic patients. Lastly, ISG15 SNPs had no influence on ISG15 levels. We demonstrates that ISG15 is elevated in viremic HIV-1 patients and is associated with high TRAIL and IDO levels. \",\"The aim of this study was to describe HIV-2 R5/X4-tropism distribution in antiretroviral-naive HIV-2-infected patients. Population sequencing of the gp105 region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells issued from 151 antiretroviral-naive patients. Tropism was successfully determined in 46 of 151 samples (30%) with six of 46 (13%) X4-tropic viruses. X4-tropism was associated with lower CD4 cell count (337 vs. 551/mm; P\\u200a=\\u200a0.032) but not with plasma viral load. Thus, X4-tropism prevalence in HIV-2 antiretroviral-naive patients is similar to that observed in HIV-1. \",\"Cryptococcosis is a cosmopolitan fungal serious condition due to an encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. This is the systemic fungal infection the most common in HIV infection. This yeast is present in the environment and its main entrance in the body is the respiratory tract. Its gravity is linked to its tropism for the central nervous system. It generally affects subjects with severe deficit of cellular immunity and in particular, patients living with HIV. The diagnosis of neuromeningeal cryptococcosis is based on the detection of encapsulated yeasts at microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid, the detection of capsular polysaccharide antigen in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but especially on the culture. A staging is always essential. The prognosis is severe. The control of intracranial hypertension is a major element of prognosis. \",\"Previous studies have shown that a major block to HIV-1 replication in common marmosets operates at the level of viral entry and that this block can be overcome by adaptation of the virus in tissue-cultured cells. However, our current studies indicate that HIV-1 encounters additional postentry blocks in common marmoset peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Here, we show that the common marmoset APOBEC3G (A3G) and BST2 proteins block HIV-1 in cell cultures. Using a directed-evolution method that takes advantage of the natural ability of HIV-1 to mutate during replication, we have been able to overcome these blocks in tissue-cultured cells. In the adapted viruses, specific changes were observed in gag, vif, env, and nef. The contribution of these changes to virus replication in the presence of the A3G and BST2 restriction factors was studied. We found that certain amino acid changes in Vif and Env that arise during adaptation to marmoset A3G and BST2 allow the virus to replicate in the presence of these restriction factors. The changes in Vif reduce expression levels and encapsidation of marmoset APOBEC3G, while the changes in Env increase viral fitness and discretely favor cell-to-cell transmission of the virus, allowing viral escape from these restriction factors. HIV-1 can infect only humans and chimpanzees. The main reason for this narrow tropism is the presence in many species of dominant-acting factors, known as restriction factors, that block viral replication in a species-specific way. We have been exploring the blocks to HIV-1 in common marmosets, with the ultimate goal of developing a new animal model of HIV-1 infection in these monkeys. In this study, we observed that common marmoset APOBEC3G and BST2, two known restriction factors, are able to block HIV-1 in cell cultures. We have adapted HIV-1 to replicate in the presence of these restriction factors and have characterized the mechanisms of escape. These studies can help in the development of a novel animal model for in vivo infection of marmosets with HIV-1-like viruses.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 92UG046 Env protein, obtained from a\\u00a0CD4-independent HIV-1 primary isolate (Zerhouni et al., 2004), has the ability to initiate an infection in HeLa cells expressing CD4 when carrying the full-length (FL) Env, but uses CD8 molecules for receptor-mediated entry when carrying a\\u00a0truncated Env (CT84). To determine whether a\\u00a0specific length or structure in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) is responsible for this alteration of tropism, we compared a\\u00a0series of Env constructs with different CT truncations and the presence or absence of an amphipathic alpha- helical sequence. We found that truncated constructs containing the alpha-helical LLP-2 structure in their CT domains conferred a\\u00a0switch from CD4 to CD8 tropism. The results support the conclusion that the structure of the CT domain can play an important role in determining receptor specificity. \",\"Allogeneic donor CCR5 \\u039432 homozygous haemopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) provides the only evidence to date of long-term control of HIV infection. However, availability of conventional CCR5 \\u039432 homozygous donors is insufficient to develop this as a therapeutic strategy further. We present a 37-year-old patient with HIV-1 infection and aggressive lymphoma who had disease progression after five lines of radiochemotherapy including an autologous HCT, and in the absence of matched sibling donors, received an allogeneic HCT with four of six HLA-matched CCR5 \\u039432 homozygous cord blood cells (StemCyte, Covina, CA), supported with purified CD34+ cells from a haploidentical sibling. Blood or tissue samples were obtained before and weekly after HCT to monitor transplant and HIV infection, including chimerism analysis, CCR5 genotyping and viral tropism, viral isolation and sequence, viral reservoir analysis, immune activation and proliferation, and ex-vivo cell infectivity assays. Combined antiretroviral therapy continued during the procedure. The patient's HIV was CCR5-tropic by genotypic and phenotypic analyses. Baseline latent reservoir tests showed HIV DNA copies in bulk and resting CD4 T cells and in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, CD4 T-cell-associated HIV RNA, replication competent viral size of 2\\u00b71 copies per 10(7) CD4 T cells, and single copy assay of 303 copies per mL. After HCT, plasma HIV DNA load was undetectable by ultrasensitive analyses. Upon cord blood full chimerism, the patient's CCR5 \\u039432 homozygous CD4 T cells responded to proliferation and activation stimuli and became resistant to infection by the patient's viral isolate and by laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains. Death related to lymphoma progression regretfully prevented long-term monitoring of the patient's viral reservoir. CCR5 \\u039432 homozygous cord blood reconstitution can successfully eliminate HIV-1 and render the allogeneic graft recipient's T lymphocytes resistant to HIV infection. Thus, they build on the evidence available to strongly support the use of cord blood as a strategic platform for a broader application of non-functional CCR5 transplantation to other infected individuals.

R5 HIV-1 binds CCR5, X4 HIV-1 binds CXCR4, and dual-tropic HIV-1 can bind either coreceptor for cellular entry. R5 viruses are associated with early infection and over time can evolve to X4 viruses that are associated with immune failure. Dual-tropic HIV-1 is less studied; however, it represents functional antigenic intermediates during the transition of R5 to X4 viruses. Viral tropism is linked partly to the HIV-1 envelope V3 domain, where the amino acid sequence helps dictate the receptor a particular virus will target; however, using V3 sequence information to identify dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates has remained difficult. Our goal in this study was to elucidate features of dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates that assist in the biological understanding of dual-tropism and develop an approach for their detection. Over 1559 HIV-1 subtype B sequences with known tropisms were analyzed. Each sequence was represented by 73 structural, biochemical and regional features. These features were provided to an evolved neural network classifier and evaluated using balanced and unbalanced data sets. The study resolved R5X4 viruses from R5 with an accuracy of 81.8% and from X4 with an accuracy of 78.8%. The approach also identified a set of V3 features (hydrophobicity, structural and polarity) that are associated with tropism transitions. The ability to distinguish R5X4 isolates will improve computational tropism decisions for R5 vs. X4 and assist in HIV-1 research and drug development efforts. \",\"In order to establish new infections HIV-1 particles need to attach to receptors expressed on the cellular surface. HIV-1 particles interact with a cell membrane receptor known as CD4 and subsequently with another cell membrane molecule known as a co-receptor. Two major different co-receptors have been identified: C-C chemokine Receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine Receptor type 4 (CXCR4) Previous reports have demonstrated cellular modifications upon HIV-1 binding to its co-receptors including gene expression modulations. Here we investigated the effect of viral binding to either CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptors on viral diversity after a single round of reverse transcription. CCR5 and CXCR4 pseudotyped viruses were used to infect non-stimulated and stimulated PBMCs and purified CD4 positive cells. We adopted the SOLiD methodology to sequence virtually the entire proviral DNA from all experimental infections. Infections with CCR5 and CXCR4 pseudotyped virus resulted in different patterns of genetic diversification. CCR5 virus infections produced extensive proviral diversity while in CXCR4 infections a more localized substitution process was observed. In addition, we present pioneering results of a recently developed method for the analysis of SOLiD generated sequencing data applicable to the study of viral quasi-species. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of viral quasi-species evaluation by NGS methodologies. We presented for the first time strong evidence for a host cell driving mechanism acting on the HIV-1 genetic variability under the control of co-receptor stimulation. Additional investigations are needed to further clarify this question, which is relevant to viral diversification process and consequent disease progression. \",\"We recently constructed two rhesus macaque-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1rmt) clones with CXCR4 or CCR5 tropism, but a CCR5-tropic HIV-1rmt clone grew more poorly than a CXCR4-topic clone. It has been demonstrated that interaction between viral Gag-matrix (MA) and Env-gp41 cytoplasmic tail is important for virion-incorporation of Env. Concordantly, Gag-MA mutations (62QR and 66SR) that rescue defects in virion-incorporation of Env/viral replication were reported. In this study, we analyzed effects of these Gag-MA mutations on R5-tropic HIV-1rmt replication potentials. While introduction of 62QR into three HIV-1rmt clones tested reduced their multi-cycle replication ability in rhesus lymphocytes or abolish single-cycle infectivity for luciferase reporter cells, three R5-tropic HIV-1rmt clones carrying 66SR exhibited similar growth kinetics to those of their parental clones. One such clone, 66SR+5gtu, appeared to induce stronger cytopathic effects than parental clone 5gtu. We therefore investigated effects of 66SR mutation on viral replication in more detail. Single-cycle infectivity of 66SR+5gtu was enhanced relative to that of 5gtu, but 66SR+5gtu virion production was significantly decreased compared to the 5gtu level. Gag-MA 66SR mutation may be useful to improve growth potentials of the R5-tropic HIV-1rmt clones.\",\"Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive cancer of CD4/CD25(+) T lymphocytes, the etiological agent of which is human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). ATL is highly refractory to current therapies, making the development of new treatments a high priority. Oncolytic viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are being considered as anticancer agents since they readily infect transformed cells compared to normal cells, the former appearing to exhibit defective innate immune responses. Here, we have evaluated the efficacy and safety of a recombinant VSV that has been retargeted to specifically infect and replicate in transformed CD4(+) cells. This was achieved by replacing the single VSV glycoprotein (G) with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp160 to create a hybrid fusion protein, gp160G. The resultant virus, VSV-gp160G, was found to only target cells expressing CD4 and retained robust oncolytic activity against HTLV-1 actuated ATL cells. VSV-gp160G was further noted to be highly attenuated and did not replicate efficiently in or induce significant cell death of primary CD4(+) T cells. Accordingly, VSV-gp160G did not elicit any evidence of neurotoxicity even in severely immunocompromised animals such as NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2R\\u03b3-c-null (NSG) mice. Importantly, VSV-gp160G effectively exerted potent oncolytic activity in patient-derived ATL transplanted into NSG mice and facilitated a significant survival benefit. Our data indicate that VSV-gp160G exerts potent oncolytic efficacy against CD4(+) malignant cells and either alone or in conjunction with established therapies may provide an effective treatment in patients displaying ATL. Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is a serious form of cancer with a high mortality rate. HTLV-1 infection is the etiological agent of ATL and, unfortunately, most patients succumb to the disease within a few years. Current treatment options have failed to significantly improve survival rate. In this study, we developed a recombinant strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that specifically targets transformed CD4(+) T cells through replacement of the G protein of VSV with a hybrid fusion protein, combining domains from gp160 of HIV-1 and VSV-G. This modification eliminated the normally broad tropism of VSV and restricted infection to primarily the transformed CD4(+) cell population. This effect greatly reduced neurotoxic risk associated with VSV infection while still allowing VSV to effectively target ATL cells.\",\"HIV-1 is typically CCR5 using (R5) and T cell tropic (T-tropic), targeting memory CD4(+) T cells throughout acute and chronic infections. However, viruses can expand into alternative cells types. Macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 variants have evolved to infect macrophages, which have only low levels of surface CD4. Most M-tropic variants have been isolated from the central nervous system during late-stage chronic infection. We used the HIV-1 env genes of well-defined, subject-matched M-tropic and T-tropic viruses to characterize the phenotypic features of the M-tropic Env protein. We found that, compared to T-tropic viruses, M-tropic viruses infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) on average 28-fold more efficiently, use low-density CD4 more efficiently, have increased sensitivity to soluble CD4 (sCD4), and show trends toward sensitivity to some CD4 binding site antibodies but no difference in sensitivity to antibodies targeting the CD4-bound conformation. M-tropic viruses also displayed a trend toward resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies targeting the V1/V2 region of Env, suggesting subtle changes in Env protein conformation. The paired M- and T-tropic viruses did not differ in autologous serum neutralization, temperature sensitivity, entry kinetics, intrinsic infectivity, or Env protein incorporation. We also examined viruses with modestly increased CD4 usage. These variants have significant sensitivity to sCD4 and may represent evolutionary intermediates. CD4 usage is strongly correlated with infectivity of MDMs over a wide range of CD4 entry phenotypes. These data suggest that emergence of M-tropic HIV-1 includes multiple steps in which a phenotype of increased sensitivity to sCD4 and enhanced CD4 usage accompany subtle changes in Env conformation. HIV-1 typically replicates in CD4(+) T cells. However, HIV-1 can evolve to infect macrophages, especially within the brain. Understanding how CCR5-using macrophage-tropic viruses evolve and differ from CCR5-using T cell-tropic viruses may provide insights into viral evolution and pathogenesis within the central nervous system. We characterized the HIV-1 env viral entry gene from subject-matched macrophage-tropic and T cell-tropic viruses to identify entry features of macrophage-tropic viruses. We observed several differences between T cell-tropic and macrophage-tropic Env proteins, including functional differences with host CD4 receptor engagement and possible changes in the CD4 binding site and V1/V2 region. We also identified viruses with phenotypes between that of \\\"true\\\" macrophage-tropic and T cell-tropic viruses, which may represent evolutionary intermediates in a multistep process to macrophage tropism.\",\"Maraviroc activity against HIV-2, a virus naturally resistant to different HIV-1 antiretroviral drugs, has been recently demonstrated. The aim of this study was to assess HIV-2 susceptibility to cenicriviroc, a novel, once-daily, dual CCR5 and CCR2 antagonist that has completed Phase 2b development in HIV-1 infection. Cenicriviroc phenotypic activity has been tested using a PBMC phenotypic susceptibility assay against four R5-, one X4- and one dual-tropic HIV-2 clinical primary isolates. All isolates were obtained by co-cultivation of PHA-activated PBMC from distinct HIV-2-infected CCR5-antagonist-na\\u00efve patients included in the French HIV-2 cohort and were previously tested for maraviroc susceptibility using the same protocol. HIV-2 tropism was determined by phenotypic assay using Ghost(3) cell lines. Regarding the 4 R5 HIV-2 clinical isolates tested, effective concentration 50% EC50 for cenicriviroc were 0.03, 0.33, 0.45 and 0.98 nM, similar to those observed with maraviroc: 1.13, 0.58, 0.48 and 0.68 nM, respectively. Maximum percentages of inhibition (MPI) of cenicriviroc were 94, 94, 93 and 98%, similar to those observed with maraviroc (93, 90, 82, 100%, respectively). The dual- and X4-tropic HIV-2 strains were resistant to cenicriviroc with EC50 >1000 nM and MPI at 33% and 4%, respectively. In this first study assessing HIV-2 susceptibility to cenicriviroc, we observed an in vitro activity against HIV-2 R5-tropic strains similar to that observed with maraviroc. Thus, cenicriviroc may offer a once-daily treatment opportunity in the limited therapeutic arsenal for HIV-2. Clinical studies are warranted.\",\"This article aims to investigate if the detection of preexisting drug-resistant minority variant (DRMV) and/or X4 HIV-1 variants could improve the efficacy of first-line combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) in late presenters. Post-hoc, combined analysis of two open-label, prospective, randomized clinical trials comparing first-line ART with efavirenz (EFV) vs. ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r)-based regimens in ART-naive, HIV-1-infected patients, with CD4 T-cell counts less than 100\\u200acells/\\u03bcl and wild-type HIV-1 by bulk sequencing. Pre-ART samples were reanalyzed for the presence of DRMVs and X4 HIV-1 using 454 sequencing. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to evaluate the association between X4 HIV and DRMVs and risk of virological failure. From 141 evaluable patients, 57 received EFV, and 84 received PI/r, including first-line ART. Median pre-ART CD4 T-cell counts and HIV-1 RNA levels were 39\\u200acells/\\u03bcl and 257\\u200a424\\u200acopies/ml, respectively; 35.5% of patients had X4 HIV variants. Detection of DRMVs leading to an ART-specific cumulative HIVdb score of at least 10 increased the risk of virological failure in patients initiating EFV [log-rank P\\u200a=\\u200a0.048, hazard ratio\\u200a=\\u200a4.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 25.0), P\\u200a=\\u200a0.074], but not in those starting PI/r. Presence of X4 HIV did not affect virological outcomes, but was associated with impaired CD4 T-cell count recovery over 2 years (214 vs. 315\\u200acells/\\u03bcl with X4 vs. R5 HIV-1 tropism, respectively, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.017). Accounting for preexisting DRMVs may improve the outcomes of first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in late presenters with advanced immune suppression. Presence of X4 HIV-1 at diagnosis predicts impaired immune restoration under ART.\",\"Allogeneic transplantation with CCR5-delta 32 (CCR5-d32) homozygous stem cells in an HIV infected individual in 2008, led to a sustained virus control and probably eradication of HIV. Since then there has been a high degree of interest to translate this approach to a wider population. There are two cellular ways to do this. The first one is to use a CCR5 negative cell source e.g., hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to copy the initial finding. However, a recent case of a second allogeneic transplantation with CCR5-d32 homozygous stem cells suffered from viral escape of CXCR4 quasi-species. The second way is to knock down CCR5 expression by gene therapy. Currently, there are five promising techniques, three of which are presently being tested clinically. These techniques include zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9), transcription activator-like effectors nuclease (TALEN), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and a ribozyme. While there are multiple gene therapy strategies being tested, in this review we reflect on our current knowledge of inhibition of CCR5 specifically and whether this approach allows for consequent viral escape. \",\"The entry tropism of HIV-1 Env proteins from virus isolated from the blood and genital tract of five men with compartmentalized lineages was determined. The Env proteins isolated from the genital tract of subject C018 were macrophage-tropic proteins, while the remaining cloned env genes encoded R5 T cell-tropic proteins. The detection of a macrophage-tropic lineage of HIV-1 within the male genital tract strongly suggests that evolution of macrophage-tropic viruses can occur in anatomically isolated sites outside the central nervous system.\",\"Combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) has changed the clinical presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) to that of the milder forms of the disease. Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) is now more prevalent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk in HIV-1-infected people. HIV-1 envelope (<i>env</i>) genetic heterogeneity has been detected within the central nervous system (CNS) of individuals with ANI. Changes within <i>env</i> determine co-receptor use, cellular tropism, and neuropathogenesis. We hypothesize that compartmental changes are associated with HIV-1 <i>env</i> C2V4 during ANI and sought to analyze paired HIV-1 <i>env</i> sequences from plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a female subject undergoing long-term cART. Paired plasma and CSF samples were collected at 12-month intervals and HIV-1 <i>env</i> C2V4 was cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of paired samples consistently showed genetic variants unique to the CSF. Phenotypic prediction showed CCR5 (R5) variants for all CSF-derived sequences and showed minor X4 variants (or dual-tropic) in the plasma at later time points. Viral compartmentalization was evident throughout the study, suggesting that the occurrence of distinctive <i>env</i> strains may contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HAND. Our study provides new insights about the genetic characteristics within the C2V4 of HIV-1 <i>env</i> that persist after long-term cART and during the course of persistent ANI.\",\"Insertion of T4 lysozyme (T4L) into the GPCR successfully enhanced GPCR protein stability and solubilization. However, the biological functions of the recombinant GPCR protein have not been analyzed. We engineered the CCR5-T4L mutant and expressed and purified the soluble recombinant protein using an E.coli expression system. The antiviral effects of this recombinant protein in THP-1 cell lines, primary human macrophages, and PBMCs from different donors were investigated. We also explored the possible mechanisms underlying the observed antiviral effects. Our data showed the biphasic inhibitory and promotion effects of different concentrations of soluble recombinant CCR5-T4L protein on R5 tropic human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in THP-1 cell lines, human macrophages, and PBMCs from clinical isolates. We demonstrated that soluble recombinant CCR5-T4L acts as a HIV-1 co-receptor, interacts with wild type CCR5, down-regulates the surface CCR5 expression in human macrophages, and interacts with CCL5 to inhibit macrophage migration. Using binding assays, we further determined that recombinant CCR5-T4L and [125I]-CCL5 compete for the same binding site on wild type CCR5. Our results suggest that recombinant CCR5-T4L protein marginally promotes HIV-1 infection at low concentrations and markedly inhibits infection at higher concentrations. This recombinant protein may be helpful in the future development of anti-HIV-1 therapeutic agents.\",\"Type-I interferons (IFNs) induce the expression of hundreds of cellular genes, some of which have direct antiviral activities. Although IFNs restrict different steps of HIV replication cycle, their dominant antiviral effect remains unclear. We first quantified the inhibition of HIV replication by IFN in tissue culture, using viruses with different tropism and growth kinetics. By combining experimental and mathematical analyses, we determined quantitative estimates for key parameters of HIV replication and inhibition, and demonstrate that IFN mainly inhibits de novo infection (33% and 47% for a X4- and a R5-strain, respectively), rather than virus production (15% and 6% for the X4 and R5 strains, respectively). This finding is in agreement with patient-derived data analyses. \",\"During the course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, a number of cell types throughout the body are infected, with the majority of cells representing CD4+ T cells and cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Both types of cells express, to varying levels, the primary receptor molecule, CD4, as well as one or both of the coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5. Viral tropism is determined by both the coreceptor utilized for entry and the cell type infected. Although a single virus may have the capacity to infect both a CD4+ T cell and a cell of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, the mechanisms involved in both the entry of the virus into the cell and the viral egress from the cell during budding and viral release differ depending on the cell type. These host-virus interactions and processes can result in the differential targeting of different cell types by selected viral quasispecies and the overall amount of infectious virus released into the extracellular environment or by direct cell-to-cell spread of viral infectivity. This review covers the major steps of virus entry and egress with emphasis on the parts of the replication process that lead to differences in how the virus enters, replicates, and buds from different cellular compartments, such as CD4+ T cells and cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has evolved a complex strategy to overcome the immune barriers it encounters throughout an organism thanks to its viral infectivity factor (Vif), a key protein for HIV-1 infectivity and in vivo pathogenesis. Vif interacts with and promotes \\\"apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G\\\" (A3G) ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, thus eluding A3G restriction activity against HIV-1. We found that cellular histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) directly interacts with A3G through its C-terminal BUZ domain (residues 841-1,215) to undergo a cellular co-distribution along microtubules and cytoplasm. The HDAC6/A3G complex occurs in the absence or presence of Vif, competes for Vif-mediated A3G degradation, and accounts for A3G steady-state expression level. In fact, HDAC6 directly interacts with and promotes Vif autophagic clearance, thanks to its C-terminal BUZ domain, a process requiring the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. HDAC6 degrades Vif without affecting the core binding factor \\u03b2 (CBF-\\u03b2), a Vif-associated partner reported to be key for Vif- mediated A3G degradation. Thus HDAC6 antagonizes the proviral activity of Vif/CBF-\\u03b2-associated complex by targeting Vif and stabilizing A3G. Finally, in cells producing virions, we observed a clear-cut correlation between the ability of HDAC6 to degrade Vif and to restore A3G expression, suggesting that HDAC6 controls the amount of Vif incorporated into nascent virions and the ability of HIV-1 particles of being infectious. This effect seems independent on the presence of A3G inside virions and on viral tropism. Our study identifies for the first time a new cellular complex, HDAC6/A3G, involved in the autophagic degradation of Vif, and suggests that HDAC6 represents a new antiviral factor capable of controlling HIV-1 infectiveness by counteracting Vif and its functions.\",\"Today, lentiviral vectors are favorable vectors for RNA interference delivery in anti-HIV therapeutic approaches. Nevertheless, problems such as the specific recognition of target cells and uncontrolled expression of the transgene can restrict their use in vivo. Herein we present a new HIV-inducible promoter to express anti-HIV short hairpin RNA (shRNA) by RNA Pol II in mammalian cells. We likewise showed a novel third-generation lentiviral vector system with more safety and a specific tropism to the target cells. The new promoter, CkRhsp, was constructed from the chicken \\u03b2-actin core promoter with the R region of HIV-1 long terminal repeat fused upstream of minimal hsp70 promoter. This system was induced by HIV-1 Tat, and activates transcription of two shRNAs against two conserved regions of HIV-1 transcripts produced in two steps of the virus life cycle. We also mimicked HIV-1 cell tropism by using the HIV-1 envelope in structure of third-generation lentiviral vector. The new fusion promoter efficiently expressed shRNA in a Tat-inducible manner. HIV-1 replication was inhibited in transient transfection and stable transduction assays. The new viral vector infected only CD4+cells. CkRhsp promoter may be safer than other inducible promoters for shRNA-mediated gene therapies against HIV. The use of the wild envelope in the vector packaging system may provide the specific targeting T lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells for anti-HIV-1 therapeutic approaches in vivo. \",\"HIV-1 variants carrying non-macrophage-tropic HIV-1 R5 envelopes (Envs) are predominantly transmitted and persist in immune tissue even in AIDS patients who have highly macrophage-tropic variants in the brain. Non-macrophage-tropic R5 Envs require high levels of CD4 for infection contrasting with macrophage-tropic Envs, which can efficiently mediate infection of cells via low CD4. Here, we investigated whether non-macrophage-tropic R5 Envs from the acute stage of infection (including transmitted/founder Env) mediated more efficient infection of ectocervical explant cultures compared to non-macrophage-tropic and highly macrophage-tropic R5 Envs from late disease. We used Env+ pseudovirions that carried a GFP reporter gene to measure infection of the first cells targeted in ectocervical explant cultures. In straight titrations of Env+ pseudovirus supernatants, mac-tropic R5 Envs from late disease mediated slightly higher infectivities for ectocervical explants although this was not significant. Surprisingly, explant infection by several T/F/acute Envs was lower than for Envs from late disease. However, when infectivity for explants was corrected to account for differences in the overall infectivity of each Env+ pseudovirus (measured on highly permissive HeLa TZM-bl cells), non-mac-tropic early and late disease Env+ pseudoviruses mediated significantly higher infection. This observation suggests that cervical tissue preferentially supports non-mac-tropic Env+ viruses compared to mac-tropic viruses. Finally, we show that T-cells were the main targets for infection regardless of whether explants were stimulated with T-cell or monocyte/macrophage cytokines. There was no evidence of macrophage infection even for pseudovirions carrying highly mac-tropic Envs from brain tissue or for the highly mac-tropic, laboratory strain, BaL, which targeted T-cells in the explant tissue. Our data support ectocervical tissue as a favorable environment for non-mac-tropic HIV-1 R5 variants and emphasize the role of T-cells as initial targets for infection even for highly mac-tropic variants.\",\"The aim of this study was to evaluate tropism prediction performances of three algorithms [geno2pheno false-positive rate 10% (G2P10), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and a combination of the 11/25 and net charge rules] and to investigate the viral and host factors potentially involved in the X4 or R5 prediction in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) patients. Viral tropism was determined in 179 HIV-1-infected patients eligible for CCR5 antagonist therapy. HIV-1 RNA or DNA was extracted and amplified for env gp120 sequencing. In parallel, demographic, viral, immunological and clinical determinants were analyzed. According to the G2P10 algorithm, 48 patients harbored X4 or X4R5 virus. The tropism prediction was concordant for 87.7 and 88.2% of samples when comparing G2P10 with PSSM or with a combination of the 11/25 and net charge rules, respectively. X4 prediction was significantly associated with more than 35 amino acids in the V3 domain (p < 0.0001) and loss of an N-linked glycosylation site (p < 0.0001). Of the factors studied, only the nadir CD4 T-cell count was significantly associated with X4 tropism (p = 0.01). We determined that the X4 virus detection is closely linked to the nadir CD4 T-cell count below 100 cells/mm(3) that must be taken into account when considering a CCR5 antagonist therapy switch.\",\"The interaction of HIV-1 and target cells involves sequential binding of the viral gp120 Env protein to the CD4 receptor and a chemokine co-receptor (either CCR5 or CXCR4). CCR5 antagonists have proved to be an effective salvage therapy in patients with CCR5 using variants (R5) but not with variants capable of using CXCR4 (\\u00d74) phenotype. Thus, it is critically important to determine cellular tropism of a country's circulating HIV strains to guide a management decision to improve treatment outcome. In this study, we report the prevalence of R5 and \\u00d74 HIV strains in 45 proviral DNA massively parallel sequencing \\\"MPS\\\" data from recently infected Brazilian blood donors. The MPS data encompassing the tropism-related V3 loop region of the HIV-1 env gene was extracted from our recently published HIV-1 genomes sequenced by a paired-end protocol (Illumina). HIV-1 tropism was inferred using Geno2pheno[coreceptor] algorithm (3.5\\u00a0% false-positive rate). V3 net charge and 11/25 rules were also used for coreceptor prediction. Among the 45 samples for which tropism were determined, 39 were exclusively R5 variants, 5 \\u00d74 variants, and one dual-tropic or mixed (D/M) populations of R5 and \\u00d74 viruses, corresponding to 86.7, 11.1 and 2.2\\u00a0%, respectively. Thus, the proportion of all blood donors that harbor CXCR4-using virus was 13.3\\u00a0% including individuals with D/M-tropic viruses. The presence of CCR5-tropic variants in more than 85\\u00a0% of our cohort of antiretroviral-na\\u00efve blood donors with recent HIV-1 infection indicates a potential benefit of CCR5 antagonists as a therapeutic option in Brazil. Therefore, determination of viral co-receptor tropism is an important diagnostic prerequisite.\",\"The goal of this present study was to determine the proportion of CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic viruses and impact of tropism test on clinical presentation, CD4 cell counts, viral load and genotypic drug resistance from drug-na\\u00efve, voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) clients in southern Taiwan. This was a cross-sectional study. Plasma samples were collected from HIV-1-infected patients from January 2013 to December 2013; subjects were recruited from free VCT centres in southern Taiwan. Taiwan. Plasma samples from 108 HIV-1-infected, treatment-na\\u00efve, VCT clients were analysed. HIV-1 strains were sequenced, genotype resistance was determined by a commercial kit (Viro-seq) and co-receptor tropism (CRT) was predicted by an internet tool geno2pheno[coreceptor], with a 10% false-positive rate as the cut-off. Differences in progression markers, patient characteristics, VCT questionnaires and HIV subtype distribution were evaluated statistically. All the 108 VCT clients were male with 90% between the ages of 20 and 40\\u2005years. Eighty-eight per cent of the patients were men who have sex with men (MSM). The median (IQR) CD4 cell count was 342 cells/\\u00b5L (221-454) and the viral load was 4.6 log (4.0-5.0). HIV-transmitted drug resistance was found in 9.3% (10/108) of the patients. CRT predictions indicated that 74% of the patients had only R5-tropic strains. CRT was not associated with CD4 cell counts, patient characteristics, VCT questionnaire and transmitted drug resistance. There was a significant difference with regard to viral load at the time of presentation, showing that patients with R5 more often had a higher viral load as compared with those with X4/DM strains (4.6\\u00b10.6 log vs 4.33\\u00b10.7 log, p=0.036). We found that 74% of the VCT clients were infected with R5-tropic virus strains. HIV-transmitted drug resistance was not associated with CRT predictions. Higher viral load at presentation was predictive of R5 co-receptor usage.\",\"An HIV-1 tropism test is recommended prior to CCR5 antagonist administration to exclude patients harboring non-R5 virus from treatment with this class of antiretrovirals. HIV-1 tropism determination based on proviral DNA (pvDNA) may be useful in individuals with plasma viral RNA suppression. We developed a genotypic tropism assay for pvDNA and assessed its performance in a retrospective analysis of samples collected longitudinally. We randomly selected paired plasma/PBMC samples from the Women's Interagency HIV Study with plasma viral load \\u22655,000 cp/mL at time 1 (T1), undetectable viral load maintained for \\u22651\\u00a0year and CD4+ >200 cells/\\u03bcL at time 2 (T2). pvDNA was isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs. Sequences were analyzed in triplicate from 49/50 women, with tropism assigned using the geno2pheno (g2p) algorithm. The median time between T1 and T2 was 4.1\\u00a0years. CXCR4-using virus was detected in 24% of the RNA samples and 33% of the pvDNA samples at T1, compared to 37% of the pvDNA samples at T2. Concordance between plasma RNA and pvDNA tropism was 88% at T1 and 80% at T2. The g2p scores for RNA (T1) vs DNA (T1, T2) were strongly correlated (Spearman rho: 0.85 (T1); 0.78 (T2)). In women with evidence of tropism switch at T2 (either R5 to non-R5 or non-R5 to R5), there was a correlation between change in tropism and time. Mean pvDNA viral load decreased by 0.4 log10 copies/106 cells between T1 and T2 (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), but this decrease was not significantly associated with tropism status. We demonstrated that pvDNA tropism in women with HIV-1 suppression is concordant with prior RNA tropism results, even after a median time of >4\\u00a0years. pvDNA tropism testing may be useful to determine eligibility of patients with viral suppression to switch to a CCR5-antagonist based regimen as well as for research purposes.\",\"NaN\",\"Compartmentalized HIV-1 replication within the central nervous system (CNS) likely provides a foundation for neurocognitive impairment and a potentially important tissue reservoir. The timing of emergence and character of this local CNS replication has not been defined in a population of subjects. We examined the frequency of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV-1 RNA concentration, the nature of CSF viral populations compared to the blood, and the presence of a cellular inflammatory response (with the potential to bring infected cells into the CNS) using paired CSF and blood samples obtained over the first two years of infection from 72 ART-na\\u00efve subjects. Using single genome amplification (SGA) and phylodynamics analysis of full-length env sequences, we compared CSF and blood viral populations in 33 of the 72 subjects. Independent HIV-1 replication in the CNS (compartmentalization) was detected in 20% of sample pairs analyzed by SGA, or 7% of all sample pairs, and was exclusively observed after four months of infection. In subjects with longitudinal sampling, 30% showed evidence of CNS viral replication or pleocytosis/inflammation in at least one time point, and in approximately 16% of subjects we observed evolving CSF/CNS compartmentalized viral replication and/or a marked CSF inflammatory response at multiple time points suggesting an ongoing or recurrent impact of the infection in the CNS. Two subjects had one of two transmitted lineages (or their recombinant) largely sequestered within the CNS shortly after transmission, indicating an additional mechanism for establishing early CNS replication. Transmitted variants were R5 T cell-tropic. Overall, examination of the relationships between CSF viral populations, blood and CSF HIV-1 RNA concentrations, and inflammatory responses suggested four distinct states of viral population dynamics, with associated mechanisms of local viral replication and the early influx of virus into the CNS. This study considerably enhances the generalizability of our results and greatly expands our knowledge of the early interactions of HIV-1 in the CNS. \",\"Non-mac-tropic HIV-1 R5 viruses are predominantly transmitted and persist in immune tissue even in AIDS patients who carry highly mac-tropic variants in the brain. Non-mac-tropic R5 envelopes (Envs) require high CD4 levels for infection contrasting with highly mac-tropic Envs, which interact more efficiently with CD4 and mediate infection of macrophages that express low CD4. Non-mac-tropic R5 Envs predominantly target T-cells during transmission and in immune tissue where they must outcompete mac-tropic variants. Here, we investigated whether Env+ pseudoviruses bearing transmitted/founder (T/F), early and late disease non-mac-tropic R5 envelopes mediated more efficient infection of CD4+ T-cells compared to those with highly mac-tropic Envs. Highly mac-tropic Envs mediated highest infectivity for primary T-cells, Jurkat/CCR5 cells, myeloid dendritic cells, macrophages, and HeLa TZM-bl cells, although this was most dramatic on macrophages. Infection of primary T-cells mediated by all Envs was low. However, infection of T-cells was greatly enhanced by increasing virus attachment with DEAE dextran and spinoculation, which enhanced the three Env+\\u2009virus groups to similar extents. Dendritic cell capture of viruses and trans-infection also greatly enhanced infection of primary T-cells. In trans-infection assays, non-mac-tropic R5 Envs were preferentially enhanced and those from late disease mediated levels of T-cell infection that were equivalent to those mediated by mac-tropic Envs. Our results demonstrate that T/F, early or late disease non-mac-tropic R5 Envs do not preferentially mediate infection of primary CD4+ T-cells compared to highly mac-tropic Envs from brain tissue. We conclude that non-macrophage-tropism of HIV-1 R5 Envs in vitro is determined predominantly by a reduced capacity to target myeloid cells via low CD4 rather than a specific adaptation for T-cells entry that precludes macrophage infection.\",\"The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, undergoes multiple molecular interactions and structural rearrangements during the course of host cell attachment and viral entry, which are being increasingly defined at the atomic level using isolated proteins. In comparison, antigenic markers of these dynamic changes are essentially unknown for single HIV-1 particles bound to target cells. Such markers should indicate how neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing antibodies might interdict infection by either blocking infection or sensitizing host cells for elimination by Fc-mediated effector function. Here we address this deficit by imaging fluorescently labeled CCR5-tropic HIV-1 pseudoviruses using confocal and superresolution microscopy to track the exposure of neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes as they appear on single HIV-1 particles bound to target cells. Epitope exposure was followed under conditions permissive or non-permissive for viral entry to delimit changes associated with virion binding from those associated with post-attachment events. We find that a previously unexpected array of gp120 epitopes is exposed rapidly upon target cell binding. This array comprises both neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes, the latter being hidden on free virions yet capable of serving as potent targets for Fc-mediated effector function. Under non-permissive conditions for viral entry, both neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitope exposures were relatively static over time for the majority of bound virions. Under entry-permissive conditions, epitope exposure patterns changed over time on subsets of virions that exhibited concurrent variations in virion contents. These studies reveal that bound virions are distinguished by a broad array of both neutralizing and non-neutralizing gp120 epitopes that potentially sensitize a freshly engaged target cell for destruction by Fc-mediated effector function and/or for direct neutralization at a post-binding step. The elucidation of these epitope exposure patterns during viral entry will help clarify antibody-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 as it is measured in vitro and in vivo. \",\"Macrophages express low levels of the CD4 receptor compared to T-cells. Macrophage-tropic HIV strains replicating in brain of untreated patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) express Envs that are adapted to overcome this restriction through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here, bioinformatic analysis of env sequence datasets together with functional studies identified polymorphisms in the \\u03b23 strand of the HIV gp120 bridging sheet that increase M-tropism. D197, which results in loss of an N-glycan located near the HIV Env trimer apex, was detected in brain in some HAD patients, while position 200 was estimated to be under positive selection. D197 and T/V200 increased fusion and infection of cells expressing low CD4 by enhancing gp120 binding to CCR5. These results identify polymorphisms in the HIV gp120 bridging sheet that overcome the restriction to macrophage infection imposed by low CD4 through enhanced gp120-CCR5 interactions, thereby promoting infection of brain and other macrophage-rich tissues. \",\"Severely immunodeficient mice such as the NOD/SCID/IL2r\\u03b3(null) (NSG) strain can be engrafted with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in chimeric mice containing many components of the human immune system (Human Immune System mice or HIS mice). HIS mice can both support the replication of and recapitulate much of the immunological response to a variety of pathogens, including ones with strict human tropism, such as HIV-1. In an effort to develop a better mouse model for human infectious pathogen infection and possible immune resolution, we compared the human immune system reconstitution of NSG mice following injection with human CD34(+) HSCs purified from either fetal liver (FL) or umbilical cord blood (UCB). We analyzed reconstitution in standard NSG mice as well as a derivative of these mice containing an HLA.A2 encoding transgene (NSG.A2). HSCs from both sources effectively reconstituted hematopoietic lineages when injected into NSG mice. In marked contrast, total CD45(+) human hematopoietic cells in NSG.A2 mice were well reconstituted by HSCs from UCB but very poorly by HSCs purified from FL. Moreover, the reconstitution of T cell lineages in NSG.A2 mice by HSCs from UCB was inferior to that obtained using NSG mice. We also found that FL CD34(+) HSCs contain a much higher percentage of cells with a phenotype consistent with primitive progenitors than UCB HSCs. We discuss possible explanations for the influence of the HLA.A2 transgene on hematopoietic reconstitution using the two sources of HSCs. \",\"After the serendipitous discovery of HIV eradication in the \\\"Berlin patient\\\", interest has grown in curing HIV infection by replacing the patient's replication-competent blood cells with infection-resistant ones. At the same time, induced pluripotent stem cell technologies and genetic engineering have boosted cell therapy transfer into the clinic. Currently available cell therapy approaches to attempt to cure HIV infection include the following: (1) Transplantation of autologous or allogeneic cells spontaneously resistant or edited to resist HIV infection; (2) Transplantation of autologous T-lymphocytes spontaneously targeting or redirected against HIV; and (3) Transplantation of autologous cells engineered to work as anti-HIV antibody factories. We review here the preliminary results and potential for future applications of these approaches.\",\"Use of CCR5 antagonists requires previous viral tropism determination. The available methods have high cost, are time-consuming, or require highly trained personnel, and sophisticated equipment. We compared a flow cytometry-based tropism assay with geno2pheno method to determine HIV-1 tropism in AIDS patients, in Bahia, Brazil. We tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 102 AIDS patients under antiretroviral therapy by using a cytometry-based tropism assay and geno2pheno assay. Cellular membrane receptors were identified by using CXCR4, CCR5 and CD4 monoclonal antibodies, while detection of cytoplasmic mRNAs for gag and pol HIV regions was achieved by using a labeled probe. Genotypic identification of X4 and R5 tropic viruses was attempted by geno2pheno algorithm. There was a high degree of concordance between cytometry-based tropism assay and geno2pheno algorithm in determination of HIV-1 tropism. Cytometry-based tropism assay demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison to geno2pheno, which was used as a gold-standard. One sample could not be amplified by geno2pheno method, but was classified as duotropic by cytometry-based tropism assay. We did not find any association between CD4+ count or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load and tropism results. The overall performances of cytometry-based tropism assay and geno2pheno assay were almost identical in determination of HIV-1 tropism. \",\"In analogy to many tissues in which mature, terminally differentiated cells are continuously replenished by the progeny of less differentiated, long-lasting stem cells, it has been suspected that memory T lymphocytes might contain small numbers of stem cell-like cells. However, only recently have such cells been physically identified and isolated from humans, mice, and nonhuman primates. These cells, termed \\\"T memory stem cells\\\" (TSCM), represent approximately 2-4\\u00a0% of all circulating T lymphocytes, seem to be extremely durable, and can rapidly differentiate into more mature central memory, effector memory, and effector T cells, while maintaining their own pool size through homeostatic self-renewal. Although it is becoming increasingly evident that that these cells have critical roles for T cell homeostasis and maintaining life-long cellular immunity against microbial pathogens during physiological conditions, they also seem intrinsically involved in many key aspects of HIV/SIV disease pathogenesis. Current data suggest that CD4+ TSCM cells represent a core element of the HIV-1 reservoir in patients treated with suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and that relative resistance of CD4+ TSCM cells to SIV represents a distinguishing feature of non-pathogenic SIV infection in natural hosts. This article summarizes recent studies investigating the role of TSCM in HIV/SIV infection. \",\"Retrospective analysis of evolution of HIV tropism and association with disease progression in perinatal HIV-1 infection (PaHIV). Eligible patients with PaHIV were grouped as slow, rapid or long-term non-progressors (LTNP). The V3 region of gp120 was sequenced from stored plasma samples and tropism determined by geno2pheno algorithm (FPR 5.75%). Logistic regression with generalised estimating equations assessed factors associated with R5 virus. Time to tropism change was assessed using standard survival methods. At baseline (n=48) median age was 12 years (IQR 9.3-14.8), 52% were female, 79% were Black African, 96% were non-B subtypes and 81% (39/48) had R5-using virus. Median follow-up was 7.7 years (308.6 person-years), with a median of five (range 1-14) samples per subject (total 252). Analysing all samples, R5 virus was associated with higher current CD4 cell count (median 520 cells/mm(3) R5 vs 202 for X4, P=0.0005), LTNP (35% vs 11%, P=0.05), non-Black ethnicity (74% vs 89%, P=0.05) and female gender (55% vs 28%, P=0.005). Twelve of 38 (31%) with R5 virus at baseline switched to X4/dual-using virus, with an estimated 5-year risk of switch of 24.4% (95% CI 9.7-39.2%) predicted by lower current CD4 cell count (unadjusted HR 0.62/50 cells higher, 95% CI 0.47-0.81, P=0.0006). Eleven of 19 (58%) with X4/dual-using virus subsequently had R5 virus at one or more time points. Maraviroc was a treatment option for 81% at 12 years, falling to 56% at 18 years, with lower CD4 cell count predictive of co-receptor switching. Paediatric studies of CCR5 antagonists should be expedited to ensure they are an early treatment option before tropism switching occurs.\",\"The circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC is the most prevalent HIV-1 strain among injection drug users (IDUs) in Taiwan. It contains a 7 amino-acid deletion in its p6gag. We conducted a cohort study to compare viral loads and CD4 cell count changes between patients infected with subtype B and CRF07_BC and to elucidate its mechanism. Twenty-one patients infected with CRF07_BC and 59 patients with subtype B were selected from a cohort of 667 HIV-1/AIDS patients whom have been followed up for 3 years. Generalized estimated equation was used to analyze their clinical data and the results showed that patients infected with CRF07_BC had significantly lower viral loads (about 58,000 copies per ml less) than patients with subtype B infection (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.002). The replicative capacity of nine CRF07_BC and four subtype B isolates were compared and the results showed that the former had significantly lower replicative capacity than the latter although all of them were CCR5- tropic and non-syncytium inducing viruses. An HIV-1-NL4-3 mutant virus which contains a 7 amino-acid deletion in p6gag (designated as 7d virus) was generated and its live cycle was investigated. The results showed that 7d virus had significantly lower replication capacity, poorer protease-mediated processing and viral proteins production. Electron microscopic examination of cells infected with wild-type or 7d virus demonstrated that the 7d virus had poorer and slower viral maturation processes: more viruses attached to the cell membrane and higher proportion of immature virions outside the cells. The interaction between p6gag and Alix protein was less efficient in cells infected with 7d virus. In conclusion, patients infected with CRF07_BC had significantly lower viral loads than patients infected with subtype B and it may due to the deletion of 7 amino acids which overlaps with Alix protein-binding domain of the p6gag. \",\"The HIV Rev protein routes viral RNAs containing the Rev Response Element (RRE) through the Crm1 nuclear export pathway to the cytoplasm where viral proteins are expressed and genomic RNA is delivered to assembling virions. The RRE assembles a Rev oligomer that displays nuclear export sequences (NESs) for recognition by the Crm1-Ran(GTP) nuclear receptor complex. Here we provide the first view of an assembled HIV-host nuclear export complex using single-particle electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, Crm1 forms a dimer with an extensive interface that enhances association with Rev-RRE and poises NES binding sites to interact with a Rev oligomer. The interface between Crm1 monomers explains differences between Crm1 orthologs that alter nuclear export and determine cellular tropism for viral replication. The arrangement of the export complex identifies a novel binding surface to possibly target an HIV inhibitor and may point to a broader role for Crm1 dimerization in regulating host gene expression. \",\"A unique HIV-host equilibrium exists in untreated HIV-2-infected individuals. This equilibrium is characterized by low to undetectable levels of viremia throughout the disease course, despite the establishment of disseminated HIV-2 reservoirs at levels comparable to those observed in untreated HIV-1 infection. Although the clinical spectrum is similar in the two infections, HIV-2 infection is associated with a much lower rate of CD4 T-cell decline and has a limited impact on the mortality of infected adults. Here we investigated HIV-2 infection of the human thymus, the primary organ for T-cell production. Human thymic tissue and suspensions of total or purified CD4 single-positive thymocytes were infected with HIV-2 or HIV-1 primary isolates using either CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors. We found that HIV-2 infected both thymic organ cultures and thymocyte suspensions, as attested to by the total HIV DNA and cell-associated viral mRNA levels. Nevertheless, thymocytes featured reduced levels of intracellular Gag viral protein, irrespective of HIV-2 coreceptor tropism and cell differentiation stage, in agreement with the low viral load in culture supernatants. Our data show that HIV-2 is able to infect the human thymus, but the HIV-2 replication cycle in thymocytes is impaired, providing a new model to identify therapeutic targets for viral replication control. HIV-1 infects the thymus, leading to a decrease in CD4 T-cell production that contributes to the characteristic CD4 T-cell loss. HIV-2 infection is associated with a very low rate of progression to AIDS and is therefore considered a unique naturally occurring model of attenuated HIV disease. HIV-2-infected individuals feature low to undetectable plasma viral loads, in spite of the numbers of circulating infected T cells being similar to those found in patients infected with HIV-1. We assessed, for the first time, the direct impact of HIV-2 infection on the human thymus. We show that HIV-2 is able to infect the thymus but that the HIV-2 replication cycle in thymocytes is impaired. We propose that this system will be important to devise immunotherapies that target viral production, aiding the design of future therapeutic strategies for HIV control.\",\"Macrophages contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis by forming a viral reservoir and mediating neurological disorders. Cell-free HIV-1 infection of macrophages is inefficient, in part due to low plasma membrane expression of viral entry receptors. We find that macrophages selectively capture and engulf HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells leading to efficient macrophage infection. Infected T cells, both healthy and dead or dying, were taken up through viral envelope glycoprotein-receptor-independent interactions, implying a mechanism distinct from conventional virological synapse formation. Macrophages infected by this cell-to-cell route were highly permissive for both CCR5-using macrophage-tropic and otherwise weakly macrophage-tropic transmitted/founder viruses but restrictive for nonmacrophage-tropic CXCR4-using virus. These results have implications for establishment of the macrophage reservoir and HIV-1 dissemination in vivo.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) use cellular receptors in distinct ways. Besides a more promiscuous usage of coreceptors by HIV-2 and a more frequent detection of CD4-independent HIV-2 isolates, we have previously identified two HIV-2 isolates (HIV-2MIC97 and HIV-2MJC97) that do not use the two major HIV coreceptors: CCR5 and CXCR4. All these features suggest that in HIV-2 the Env glycoprotein subunits may have a different structural organization enabling distinct - although probably less efficient - interactions with cellular receptors. By infectivity assays using GHOST cell line expressing CD4 and CCR8 and blocking experiments using CCR8-specific ligand, I-309, we show that efficient replication of HIV-2MIC97 and HIV-2MJC97 requires the presence of CCR8 at plasma cell membrane. Additionally, we disclosed the determinants of chemokine receptor usage at the molecular level, and deciphered the amino acids involved in the usage of CCR8 (R8 phenotype) and in the switch from CCR8 to CCR5 or to CCR5/CXCR4 usage (R5 or R5X4 phenotype). The data obtained from site-directed mutagenesis clearly indicates that the main genetic determinants of coreceptor tropism are located within the V1/V2 region of Env surface glycoprotein of these two viruses. We conclude that a viral population able to use CCR8 and unable to infect CCR5 or CXCR4-positive cells, may exist in some HIV-2 infected individuals during an undefined time period, in the course of the asymptomatic stage of infection. This suggests that in vivo alternate molecules might contribute to HIV infection of natural target cells, at least under certain circumstances. Furthermore we provide direct and unequivocal evidence that the usage of CCR8 and the switch from R8 to R5 or R5X4 phenotype is determined by amino acids located in the base and tip of V1 and V2 loops of HIV-2 Env surface glycoprotein.\",\"There are few data on the clinical and virological factors associated with the virological response (VR) of maraviroc (MVC) in clinical practice. This study aimed to identify factors associated with the VR to MVC-containing regimens in 104 treatment-experienced but CCR5 inhibitor-naive HIV-1 patients. VR was defined at month 3 (M3) as HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) <50 copies/ml. The impact on VR of age, sex, baseline tropism, HIV subtype (B vs. non-B), nadir CD4 cell count and CD4 cell count, baseline VL, genotypic susceptibility score of treatment, once or twice daily treatment, presence of raltegravir in optimized background therapy, and MVC concentrations was investigated. Median baseline VL was 3.3 log10 copies/ml (range 1.7-6.0 log10 copies/ml) and CD4 cell count was 299 cells/mm(3) (range 7-841 cells/mm(3)). At M3, 53.8% of patients were responders. In univariate analysis, a better efficacy of the MVC-containing regimen was associated with a high CD4 cell count (p=0.0069) and there was a trend for low baseline VL, high nadir CD4 cell count, and HIV subtype (B versus non-B). Only low baseline VL remained significantly associated with better VR in the multivariate analysis. This study demonstrated a VR of an optimized antiretroviral treatment including MVC in clinical practice similar to that observed in clinical trials. The factors associated with VR were higher baseline CD4 cell count in univariate analysis and lower baseline VL in multivariate analysis. \",\"HIV/HCV coinfection is a risk factor for hepatic injury in patients receiving HAART and previous studies support a favourable effect of antiretroviral regimens including maraviroc (MVC) on the course of coinfection compared with other antiretroviral drugs. There are few observations about MVC use in simplified treatment of coinfected patients. To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of simplification to darunavir (DRV)/ritonavir (r)/maraviroc (MVC) in virologically HIV-suppressed patients and to explore the effect of simplified treatment on coinfected patients. GUSTA study is a randomized two arms trial that compares the switch to DRV/r/MVC with standard HAART with three drugs. The study enrols patients with HIV-1 RNA<50cp/mL>6 months, R5 tropism, CD4>200 cells/mm. Survival analysis was used to analyze factors associated to time-to a single viral load (VL) over 50cp/mL and FIB-4>1.45. We included 62 patients with at least the 24 week follow-up for FIB-4 analysis: males 75.8%, heterosexuals 48.4%, HCV+12.9% median age 48.3 years (IQR41.1;53.5), time from HIV diagnosis 11.0 years (IQR7.3;16.7), CD4 cells 659/mm (IQR478;882), nadir CD4 203/mm (IQR115;286), FPR 46 (IQR30;70), baseline (BL) FIB-4 1.11 (IQR0.75;1.35). At BL no differences were observed in the two arms, except for platelets (-34.96 109/L, in the study arm, p=0.028) and CD4 at nadir (-70cell/\\u00b5L, p0.051). After 24 weeks a significant reduction in total bilirubin (TB) (-0.55 mg/dL, p=0.025) and alkaline phosphatase(AP) (-12.96 UI/L, p=0.002) was observed in the study group. A statistically significant difference in mean change of TB (0.61 mg/dL, p=0.016) and AP (13.23 UI/L, p=0.04) at 24 week between control and study group was observed. No grade 3/4 transaminase elevation was observed for any patient even if HIV/HCV coinfected and receiving MVC. A single HCV negative patient in the control arm had grade 3 bilirubin increase. Including all patients with at least one follow-up HCV status was not associated with an increased risk of detectable VL (n=114, 4072 person-week-follow-up [IQR12;51.6]), nor with FIB-4>1.45 (n=98, 3513 person-week-follow-up [IQR11.4;50.9]). The initial results from GUSTA study show that ART-regimen including MVC did not increase the incidence of adverse events or severe laboratory liver abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients with or without HCV coinfection. Coinfected patients did not show an increased risk of failure on simplification treatment with MVC/DRV/r.\",\"It is uncertain if plasma HIV-1 tropism is an independent predictor of short-term risk of clinical progression / death, in addition to the CD4 count and HIV RNA level. We conducted a nested case-control study within EuroSIDA to assess this question amongst people with current HIV RNA level >1000 copies/mL, including both people on ART and those ART na\\u00efve. People with an AIDS diagnosis or who died from any causes for whom there was a stored plasma sample with HIV-1 RNA (VL)\\u22651,000 copies/mL available in the time window of 3-12 months prior to the event were identified. At least one control was selected for each case matched for age, VL and HCV status at the time of sampling. Controls were event-free after a matched duration of time from the date of sampling. Plasma HIV tropism was estimated using 454 and population sequencing (PS). Non-R5 HIV was defined as: (a) \\u22652% of sequences with a Geno2Pheno (G2P) FPR\\u22643.75% by 454, and (b) a G2P FPR\\u226410% by PS. We also compared CD4 slopes over the 12 months following the date of sampling using a linear mixed model with random intercept according to HIV tropism and ART status. The study included 266 subjects, 100 cases and 166 controls, with sample taken on average in 2006; 23% and 24% had non-R5 HIV by 454 and PS respectively. There were 19% women, 25% MSM, 92% Caucasians, 22% HCV+. At the time of sampling, 26% were ART-na\\u00efve, 25% had started but were off ART and 49% were receiving ART. The median age, CD4 and viral load was 41 years, 350 cells/mm(3) and 4.81 log c/mL, respectively. Baseline characteristics were well balanced by tropism. Factors independently associated with clinical progression or death were female gender (OR=2.12; 95% CI=1.04, 4.36; p=0.038), CD4+ count (OR=0.90 per 100 cells/mm(3) higher; 95% CI 0.80, 1.00; p=0.058), being on ART (OR=2.72; 95% CI 1.15, 6.41; p=0.022) and calendar year of sample (OR=0.84 per more recent year; 95% CI=0.77, 0.91; p<0.001). Baseline plasma tropism was not an independent risk factor for clinical progression or death by either 454 or PS. No significant interaction was observed between tropism and ART status. There were no significant differences in the CD4+ slope within or between tropism groups. Plasma HIV-1 tropism does not appear to add to the ability of CD4 count and viral load to predict the short term risk of AIDS and death outcomes, even with 454 sequencing.\",\"In a previous interim 24-week virological safety analysis of the PROTEST study (1), initiation of Maraviroc (MVC) plus 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in aviremic subjects based on genotypic tropism testing of proviral HIV-1 DNA was associated with low rates of virological failure. Here we present the final 48-week analysis of the study. PROTEST was a phase 4, prospective, single-arm clinical trial (ID: NCT01378910) carried on in 24 HIV care centres in Spain. Maraviroc-na\\u00efve HIV-1-positive adults with HIV-1 RNA (VL) <50 c/mL on stable ART during the previous 6 months, requiring an ART change due to toxicity, with no antiretroviral resistance to the ART started, and R5 HIV by proviral DNA genotypic tropism testing (defined as a G2P FPR >10% in a singleton), initiated MVC with 2 NRTIs and were followed for 48 weeks. Virological failure was defined as two consecutive VL>50 c/mL. Recent adherence was calculated as: (# pills taken/# pills prescribed during the previous week)*100. Tropism results were available from 141/175 (80.6%) subjects screened: 87/141 (60%) were R5 and 74/87 (85%) were finally included in the study. Their median age was 48 years, 16% were women, 31% were MSM, 36% had CDC category C at study entry, 62% were HCV+ and 10% were HBV+. Median CD4+ counts were 616 cells/mm(3) at screening, and median nadir CD4+ counts were 143 cells/mm(3). Previous ART included PIs in 46 (62%) subjects, NNRTIs in 27 (36%) and integrase inhibitors (INIs) in 1 (2%). The main reasons for treatment change were dyslipidemia (42%), gastrointestinal symptoms (22%), and liver toxicity (15%). MVC was given alongside TDF/FTC in 40 (54%) subjects, ABC/3TC in 30 (40%), AZT/3TC in 2 (3%) and ABC/TDF in 2 (3%). Sixty-two (84%) subjects maintained VL<50 c/mL through week 48, whereas 12 (16%) discontinued treatment: two (3%) withdrew informed consent, one (1%) had a R5\\u2192X4 shift in HIV tropism between the screening and baseline visits, one (1%) was lost to follow-up, one (1%) developed an ART-related adverse event (rash), two (3%) died due to non-study-related causes (1 myocardial infarction at week 0 and 1 lung cancer at week 36), and five (7%) developed protocol-defined virological failure, although two of them regained VL<50 c/mL with the same MVC regimen (Table 1). Initiation of MVC plus 2 NRTIs in aviremic subjects based on genotypic tropism testing of proviral HIV-1 DNA is associated with low rates of virological failure up to one year.\",\"The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) is a critical determinant of viral infectivity, tropism and is the main target for humoral immunity; however, little is known about the cellular machinery that directs Env trafficking and its incorporation into nascent virions. Here we identify the mammalian retromer complex as a novel and important cellular factor regulating Env trafficking. Retromer mediates endosomal sorting and is most closely associated with endosome-to-Golgi transport. Consistent with this function, inactivating retromer using RNAi targeting the cargo selective trimer complex inhibited retrograde trafficking of endocytosed Env to the Golgi. Notably, in HIV-1 infected cells, inactivating retromer modulated plasma membrane expression of Env, along with Env incorporation into virions and particle infectivity. Mutagenesis studies coupled with coimmunoprecipitations revealed that retromer-mediated trafficking requires the Env cytoplasmic tail that we show binds directly to retromer components Vps35 and Vps26. Taken together these results provide novel insight into regulation of HIV-1 Env trafficking and infectious HIV-1 morphogenesis and show for the first time a role for retromer in the late-steps of viral replication and assembly of a virus. \",\"CD4(+) memory T-cells are a major target for infection by HIV-1, whereby latent provirus can establish and endure suppressive antiretroviral therapies. Although HIV-1 subtype C strains (C-HIV) account for the majority of HIV-1 infections worldwide, the susceptibility of CD4(+) memory T-cells to infection by CCR5- (R5) and CXCR4-using (X4) C-HIV is unknown. Here, we quantified the susceptibility of na\\u00efve and memory CD4(+) T-cell subsets, including stem cell memory T-cells (TSCM), to infection by HIV-1 subtype C (C-HIV) strains from treatment-na\\u00efve subjects who progressed from chronic to advanced stages of disease whilst either maintaining CCR5-using (R5) viruses (subjects 1503 and 1854), or who experienced emergence of dominant CXCR4-using (X4) strains (subject 1109). We show that R5 and X4 C-HIV viruses preferentially target memory and na\\u00efve CD4(+) T-cell subsets, respectively. While TSCM were susceptible to infection by both R5 and X4 C-HIV viruses, the proportion of infected CD4(+) T-cells that were TSCM was higher for R5 strains. Mutagenesis studies of subject 1109 viruses established the V3 region of env as the determinant underlying the preferential targeting of na\\u00efve CD4(+) T-cells by emergent X4 C-HIV variants in this subject. In contrast, the tropism of R5 C-HIV viruses for CD4(+) T-cell subsets was maintained from chronic to advanced stages of disease in subjects 1503 and 1854. This study provides new insights into the natural history of tropism alterations for CD4(+) T-cell subsets by C-HIV strains during progression from chronic to advanced stages of infection. Although not preferentially targeted, our data suggest that TSCM and other memory CD4(+) T-cells are likely to be viral reservoirs in subjects with X4 C-HIV infection.\",\"The use of CCR5 antagonists involves determination of HIV-1 tropism prior to initiation of treatment. HIV-1 tropism can be assessed either by phenotypic or genotypic methods. Genotypic methods are extensively used for tropism prediction. However, their validation in predicting tropism of viral isolates belonging to group M non-B subtypes remains challenging. In Cameroon, the genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains is the broadest reported worldwide. To facilitate the integration of CCR5 antagonists into clinical practice in this region, there is a need to evaluate the performance of genotypic methods for predicting tropism of highly diverse group M HIV-1 strains. Tropism of diverse HIV-1 strains isolated from PBMCs from Cameroon was determined using the GHOST cell assay. Prediction, based on V3 sequences from matched plasma samples, was determined using bioinformatics algorithms and rules based on position 11/25 and net charge applied independently or combined according to Delobel's and Garrido's rules. Performance of genotypic methods was evaluated by comparing prediction generated with tropism assigned by the phenotypic assay. Specificity for predicting R5-tropic virus was high, ranging from 83.7% to 97.7% depending on the genotypic methods used. Sensitivity for X4-tropic viruses was fairly low, ranging from 33.3% to 50%. In our study, overall, genotypic methods were less able to accurately predict X4-tropic virus belonging to subtype CRF02_AG. In addition, it was found that of the methods we used the Garrido rule has the highest sensitivity rate of over 50% with a specificity of 93%. Our study demonstrated that overall, genotypic methods were less sensitive for accurate prediction of HIV-1 tropism in settings where diverse HIV-1 strains co-circulate. Our data suggest that further optimization of genotypic methods is needed and that larger studies to determine their utility for tropism prediction of diverse HIV-1 strains may be warranted.\",\"Genotype-based algorithms are valuable tools for the identification of patients eligible for CCR5 inhibitors administration in clinical practice. Among the available methods, geno2pheno[coreceptor] (G2P) is the most used online tool for tropism prediction. This study was conceived to assess if the combination of G2P prediction with V3 peptide net charge (NC) value could improve the accuracy of tropism prediction. A total of 172 V3 bulk sequences from 143 patients were analyzed by G2P and NC values. A phenotypic assay was performed by cloning the complete env gene and tropism determination was assessed on U87_CCR5(+)/CXCR4(+) cells. Sequences were stratified according to the agreement between NC values and G2P results. Of sequences predicted as X4 by G2P, 61% showed NC values higher than 5; similarly, 76% of sequences predicted as R5 by G2P had NC values below 4. Sequences with NC values between 4 and 5 were associated with different G2P predictions: 65% of samples were predicted as R5-tropic and 35% of sequences as X4-tropic. Sequences identified as X4 by NC value had at least one positive residue at positions known to be involved in tropism prediction and positive residues in position 32. These data supported the hypothesis that NC values between 4 and 5 could be associated with the presence of dual/mixed-tropic (DM) variants. The phenotypic assay performed on a subset of sequences confirmed the tropism prediction for concordant sequences and showed that NC values between 4 and 5 are associated with DM tropism. These results suggest that the combination of G2P and NC could increase the accuracy of tropism prediction. A more reliable identification of X4 variants would be useful for better selecting candidates for Maraviroc (MVC) administration, but also as a predictive marker in coreceptor switching, strongly associated with the phase of infection.\",\"Maraviroc (MVC) is licensed in clinical practice for patients with R5 virus and virological failure; however, in anecdotal reports, dual/mixed viruses were also inhibited. We retrospectively evaluated the evolution of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of an infected adolescent with a CCR5/CXCR4 Trofile profile who experienced an important but temporary immunological and virological response during a 16-month period of MVC-based therapy. Coreceptor usage of biological viral clones isolated from PBMCs was investigated in U87.CD4 cells expressing wild-type or chimeric CCR5 and CXCR4. Plasma and PBMC-derived viral clones were sequenced to predict coreceptor tropism using the geno2pheno algorithm from the V3 envelope sequence and pol gene-resistant mutations. From start to 8.5 months of MVC treatment only R5X4 viral clones were observed, whereas at 16 months the phenotype enlarged to also include R5 and X4 clones. Chimeric receptor usage suggested the preferential usage of the CXCR4 coreceptor by the R5X4 biological clones. According to phenotypic data, R5 viruses were susceptible, whereas R5X4 and X4 viruses were resistant to RANTES and MVC in vitro. Clones at 16 months, but not at baseline, showed an amino acidic resistance pattern in protease and reverse transcription genes, which, however, did not drive their tropisms. The geno2pheno algorithm predicted at baseline R5 viruses in plasma, and from 5.5 months throughout follow-up only CXCR4-using viruses. An extended methodological approach is needed to unravel the complexity of the phenotype and variation of viruses resident in the different compartments of an infected individual. The accurate evaluation of the proportion of residual R5 viruses may guide therapeutic intervention in highly experienced patients with limited therapeutic options.\",\"Murine cells exhibit a profound block to HIV-1 virion production that was recently mapped to a species-specific structural attribute of the murine version of the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (mCRM1) nuclear export receptor and rescued by the expression of human CRM1 (hCRM1). In human cells, the HIV-1 Rev protein recruits hCRM1 to intron-containing viral mRNAs encoding the Rev response element (RRE), thereby facilitating viral late gene expression. Here we exploited murine 3T3 fibroblasts as a gain-of-function system to study hCRM1's species-specific role in regulating Rev's effector functions. We show that Rev is rapidly exported from the nucleus by mCRM1 despite only weak contributions to HIV-1's posttranscriptional stages. Indeed, Rev preferentially accumulates in the cytoplasm of murine 3T3 cells with or without hCRM1 expression, in contrast to human HeLa cells, where Rev exhibits striking en masse transitions between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Efforts to bias Rev's trafficking either into or out of the nucleus revealed that Rev encoding a second CRM1 binding domain (Rev-2xNES) or Rev-dependent viral gag-pol mRNAs bearing tandem RREs (GP-2xRRE), rescue virus particle production in murine cells even in the absence of hCRM1. Combined, these results suggest a model wherein Rev-associated nuclear export signals cooperate to regulate the number or quality of CRM1's interactions with viral Rev/RRE ribonucleoprotein complexes in the nucleus. This mechanism regulates CRM1-dependent viral gene expression and is a determinant of HIV-1's capacity to produce virions in nonhuman cell types. Cells derived from mice and other nonhuman species exhibit profound blocks to HIV-1 replication. Here we elucidate a block to HIV-1 gene expression attributable to the murine version of the CRM1 (mCRM1) nuclear export receptor. In human cells, hCRM1 regulates the nuclear export of viral intron-containing mRNAs through the activity of the viral Rev adapter protein that forms a multimeric complex on these mRNAs prior to recruiting hCRM1. We demonstrate that Rev-dependent gene expression is poor in murine cells despite the finding that, surprisingly, the bulk of Rev interacts efficiently with mCRM1 and is rapidly exported from the nucleus. Instead, we map the mCRM1 defect to the apparent inability of this factor to engage Rev multimers in the context of large viral Rev/RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes. These findings shed new light on HIV-1 gene regulation and could inform the development of novel antiviral strategies that target viral gene expression.\",\"While exploring the effects of aerosol IFN-\\u03b3 treatment in HIV-1/tuberculosis co-infected patients, we observed A to G mutations in HIV-1 envelope sequences derived from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of aerosol IFN-\\u03b3-treated patients and induction of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) in the BAL cells. IFN-\\u03b3 induced ADAR1 expression in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) but not T cells. ADAR1 siRNA knockdown induced HIV-1 expression in BAL cells of four HIV-1 infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were obtained in MDM that were HIV-1 infected in vitro. Over-expression of ADAR1 in transformed macrophages inhibited HIV-1 viral replication but not viral transcription measured by nuclear run-on, suggesting that ADAR1 acts post-transcriptionally. The A to G hyper-mutation pattern observed in ADAR1 over-expressing cells in vitro was similar to that found in the lungs of HIV-1 infected patients treated with aerosol IFN-\\u03b3 suggesting the model accurately represented alveolar macrophages. Together, these results indicate that ADAR1 restricts HIV-1 replication post-transcriptionally in macrophages harboring HIV-1 provirus. ADAR1 may therefore contribute to viral latency in macrophages. \",\"HIV-1 exhibits a narrow host range, hindering the development of a robust animal model of pathogenesis. Past studies have demonstrated that the restricted host range of HIV-1 may be largely due to the inability of the virus to antagonize and evade effector molecules of the interferon response in other species. They have also guided the engineering of HIV-1 clones that can replicate in CD4 T-cells of Asian macaque species. However, while replication of these viruses in macaque hosts is persistent, it has been limited and without progression to AIDS. In a new study, Hatziioannou et al., demonstrate for the first time that adapted macaque-tropic HIV-1 can persistently replicate at high levels in pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), but only if CD8 T-cells are depleted at the time of inoculation. The infection causes rapid disease and recapitulates several aspects of AIDS in humans. Additionally, the virus undergoes genetic changes to further escape innate immunity in association with disease progression. Here, the importance of these findings is discussed, as they relate to pathogenesis and model development. \",\"We sought to test whether vaccine-induced immune responses could protect rhesus macaques (RMs) against upfront heterologous challenges with an R5 simian-human immunodeficiency virus, SHIV-2873Nip. This SHIV strain exhibits many properties of transmitted HIV-1, such as tier 2 phenotype (relatively difficult to neutralize), exclusive CCR5 tropism, and gradual disease progression in infected RMs. Since no human AIDS vaccine recipient is likely to encounter an HIV-1 strain that exactly matches the immunogens, we immunized the RMs with recombinant Env proteins heterologous to the challenge virus. For induction of immune responses against Gag, Tat, and Nef, we explored a strategy of immunization with overlapping synthetic peptides (OSP). The immune responses against Gag and Tat were finally boosted with recombinant proteins. The vaccinees and a group of ten control animals were given five low-dose intrarectal (i.r.) challenges with SHIV-2873Nip. All controls and seven out of eight vaccinees became systemically infected; there was no significant difference in viremia levels of vaccinees vs. controls. Prevention of viremia was observed in one vaccinee which showed strong boosting of virus-specific cellular immunity during virus exposures. The protected animal showed no challenge virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in the TZM-bl or A3R5 cell-based assays and had low-level ADCC activity after the virus exposures. Microarray data strongly supported a role for cellular immunity in the protected animal. Our study represents a case of protection against heterologous tier 2 SHIV-C by vaccine-induced, virus-specific cellular immune responses. \",\"HIV-1 replication in the central nervous system (CNS) is typically limited by the availability of target cells. HIV-1 variants that are transmitted and dominate the early stages of infection almost exclusively use the CCR5 coreceptor and are well adapted to entering, and thus infecting, cells expressing high CD4 densities similar to those found on CD4+ T cells. While the \\\"immune privileged\\\" CNS is largely devoid of CD4+ T cells, macrophage and microglia are abundant throughout the CNS. These cells likely express CD4 densities that are too low to facilitate efficient entry or allow sustained replication by most HIV-1 isolates. Examination of CNS viral populations reveals that late in disease the CNS of some individuals contains HIV-1 lineages that have evolved the ability to enter cells expressing low levels of CD4 and are well-adapted to entering macrophages. These macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) viruses are able to maintain sustained replication in the CNS for many generations, and their presence is associated with severe neurocognitive impairment. Whether conditions such as pleocytosis are necessary for macrophage-tropic viruses to emerge in the CNS is unknown, and extensive examinations of macrophage-tropic variants have not revealed a genetic signature of this phenotype. It is clear, however, that macrophage tropism is rare among HIV-1 isolates and is not transmitted, but is important due to its pathogenic effects on hosts. Prior to the evolution of macrophage-tropic variants, the viruses that are predominately infecting T cells (R5 T cell-tropic) may infect macrophages at a low level and inefficiently, but this could contribute to the reservoir. \",\"TRIM5\\u03b1 is a potent anti-retroviral factor that interacts with viral capsid (CA) in a species-specific manner. Recently, we and others reported generation of two distinct HIV-1 CAs that effectively overcome rhesus TRIM5\\u03b1-imposed species barrier. In this study, to directly compare the effect of different mutations in the two HIV-1 CAs on evasion from macaque TRIM5-restriction, we newly generated macaque-tropic HIV-1 (HIV-1mt) proviral clones carrying the distinct CAs in the same genomic backbone, and examined their replication abilities in macaque TRIM5-overexpressing human cells and in rhesus cells. Comparative analysis of amino acid sequences and homology modeling-based structures revealed that, while both CAs gained some mutated amino acids with similar physicochemical properties, their overall appearances of N-terminal domains were different. Experimentally, the two CAs exhibited incomplete TRIM5\\u03b1-resistance relative to SIVmac239 CA and different degrees of susceptibility to various TRIM5 proteins. Finally, two HIV-1mt clones carrying a different combination of the CA mutations were found to grow to a comparable extent in established and primary rhesus cells. Our data show that there could be some distinct CA patterns to confer significant TRIM5-resistance on HIV-1. \",\"The initial steps of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) replication cycle play a crucial role that arbitrates viral tropism and infection efficiency. Before the release of its genome into the host cell cytoplasm, viruses operate a complex sequence of events that take place at the plasma membrane of the target cell. The first step is the binding of the HIV protein envelope (Env) to the cellular receptor CD4. This triggers conformational changes of the gp120 viral protein that allow its interaction with a co-receptor that can be either CCR5 or CXCR4, defining the tropism of the virus entering the cell. This sequential interaction finally drives the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane or to the endocytosis of the viruses. Here, we discuss how the membrane composition and organization of both the virus and the target cell can affect these steps and thus influence the capability of the viruses to infect cells. \",\"We previously found that a very low geno2pheno false positive rate (FPR \\u2264 2%) defines a viral population associated with low CD4 cell count and the highest amount of X4-quasispecies. In this study, we aimed at evaluating whether FPR \\u2264 2% might impact on the viro-immunological response in HIV-1 infected patients starting a first-line HAART. The analysis was performed on 305 HIV-1 B subtype infected drug-na\\u00efve patients who started their first-line HAART. Baseline FPR (%) values were stratified according to the following ranges: \\u2264 2; 2-5; 5-10; 10-20; 20-60; >60. The impact of genotypically-inferred tropism on the time to achieve immunological reconstitution (a CD4 cell count gain from HAART initiation \\u2265 150 cells/mm(3)) and on the time to achieve virological success (the first HIV-RNA measurement <50 copies/mL from HAART initiation) was evaluated by survival analyses. Overall, at therapy start, 27% of patients had FPR \\u2264 10 (6%, FPR \\u2264 2; 7%, FPR 2-5; 14%, FPR 5-10). By 12 months of therapy the rate of immunological reconstitution was overall 75.5%, and it was significantly lower for FPR \\u2264 2 (54.1%) in comparison to other FPR ranks (78.8%, FPR 2-5; 77.5%, FPR 5-10; 71.7%, FPR 10-20; 81.8%, FPR 20-60; 75.1%, FPR >60; p = 0.008). The overall proportion of patients achieving virological success was 95.5% by 12 months of therapy. Multivariable Cox analyses showed that patients having pre-HAART FPR \\u2264 2% had a significant lower relative adjusted hazard [95% C.I.] both to achieve immunological reconstitution (0.37 [0.20-0.71], p = 0.003) and to achieve virological success (0.50 [0.26-0.94], p = 0.031) than those with pre-HAART FPR >60%. Beyond the genotypically-inferred tropism determination, FPR \\u2264 2% predicts both a poor immunological reconstitution and a lower virological response in drug-na\\u00efve patients who started their first-line therapy. This parameter could be useful to identify patients potentially with less chance of achieving adequate immunological reconstitution and virological undetectability.\",\"Although an independent evolution of viral quasispecies in different body sites might determine a differential compartmentalization of viral variants, the aim of this paper was to establish whether sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma provide different or complementary information on HIV tropism in patients with acute or chronic infection. Tropism was predicted using genotypic testing combined with geno2pheno (coreceptor) analysis at a 10% false positive rate in paired RNA and DNA samples from 75 antiretroviral-na\\u00efve patients (divided on the basis of avidity index into patients with a recent or long-lasting infection). A high prevalence of R5 HIV strains (97%) was observed in both compartments (plasma and PBMCs) in patients infected recently. By contrast, patients with a long-lasting infection showed a quite different situation in the two compartments, revealing more (46%) X4/DM in PBMCs than patients infected recently (3%) (P\\u2009=\\u20090.008). As- a knowledge of viral strains in different biological compartments might be crucial to establish a therapeutic protocol, it could be extremely useful to detect not only viral strains in plasma, but also viruses hidden or archived in different cell compartments to better understand disease evolution and treatment efficacy in patients infected with HIV.\",\"Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 enters host cells through interaction of its V3 loop (which is part of the gp120 protein) with the host cell receptor CD4 and one of two co-receptors, namely CCR5 or CXCR4. Entry inhibitors binding the CCR5 co-receptor can prevent viral entry. As these drugs are only available for CCR5-using viruses, accurate prediction of this so-called co-receptor tropism is important in order to ensure an effective personalized therapy. With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now possible to sequence representative subpopulations of the viral quasispecies. Here we present T-CUP 2.0, a model for predicting co-receptor tropism. Based on our recently published T-CUP model, we developed a more accurate and even faster solution. Similarly to its predecessor, T-CUP 2.0 models co-receptor tropism using information of the electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity of V3-loops. However, extracting this information from a simplified structural vacuum-model leads to more accurate and faster predictions. The area-under-the-ROC-curve (AUC) achieved with T-CUP 2.0 on the training set is 0.968\\u00b10.005 in a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. When applied to an independent dataset, T-CUP 2.0 has an improved prediction accuracy of around 3% when compared to the original T-CUP. We found that it is possible to model co-receptor tropism in HIV-1 based on a simplified structure-based model of the V3 loop. In this way, genotypic prediction of co-receptor tropism is very accurate, fast and can be applied to large datasets derived from next-generation sequencing technologies. The reduced complexity of the electrostatic modeling makes T-CUP 2.0 independent from third-party software, making it easy to install and use.\",\"The role of HIV-1 minority variants on transmission, pathogenesis, and virologic failure to antiretroviral regimens has been explored; however, most studies of low-level HIV-1 drug-resistant variants have focused in single target regions. Here we used a novel HIV-1 genotypic assay based on deep sequencing, DEEPGEN (Gibson et al 2014 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 58\\u22362167) to simultaneously analyze the presence of minority variants carrying mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase strand transfer integrase inhibitors (INSTIs), as well as HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/INT and env/C2V3 PCR products were obtained from twelve heavily treatment-experienced patients experiencing virologic failure while participating in a 48-week dose-ranging study of elvitegravir (GS-US-183-0105). Deep sequencing results were compared with (i) virological response to treatment, (ii) genotyping based on population sequencing, (iii) phenotyping data using PhenoSense and VIRALARTS, and (iv) HIV-1 coreceptor tropism based on the phenotypic test VERITROP. Most patients failed the antiretroviral regimen with numerous pre-existing mutations in the PR and RT, and additionally newly acquired INSTI-resistance mutations as determined by population sequencing (mean 9.4, 5.3, and 1.4 PI- RTI-, and INSTI-resistance mutations, respectively). Interestingly, since DEEPGEN allows the accurate detection of amino acid substitutions at frequencies as low as 1% of the population, a series of additional drug resistance mutations were detected by deep sequencing (mean 2.5, 1.5, and 0.9, respectively). The presence of these low-abundance HIV-1 variants was associated with drug susceptibility, replicative fitness, and coreceptor tropism determined using sensitive phenotypic assays, enhancing the overall burden of resistance to all four antiretroviral drug classes. Further longitudinal studies based on deep sequencing tests will help to clarify (i) the potential impact of minority HIV-1 drug resistant variants in response to antiretroviral therapy and (ii) the importance of the detection of HIV minority variants in the clinical practice. \",\"The ability to enter monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) <i>in vitro</i> is commonly used to define macrophage-tropic HIV-1 despite the fact that viruses vary continuously in their ability to enter MDMs <i>in vitro</i>, and MDMs vary in their ability to support HIV-1 entry (Joseph <i>et al.</i>, 2014; Peters <i>et al.</i>, 2006). This makes it difficult to distinguish viruses that are adapted to replicating in macrophage from those that are adapted to replicating in T cells. We use the Affinofile cell line (Johnston <i>et al.</i>, 2009) to assay for macrophage tropism by capitalizing on the fact that macrophage-tropic HIV-1 has an enhanced ability to enter cells expressing low levels of CD4 (Joseph <i>et al.</i>, 2014; Peters <i>et al.</i>, 2006; Duenas-Decamp <i>et al.</i>, 2009; Dunfee <i>et al.</i>, 2006; Gorry <i>et al.</i>, 2002; Martin-Garcia <i>et al.</i>, 2006; Peters <i>et al.</i>, 2004) and Affinofile cells can be induced to express a wide range of CD4 densities (Johnston <i>et al.</i>, 2009). We induce Affinofile cells to express either high or low CD4, infect those cells with pseudotyped reporter virus, and quantify percent infectivity at low CD4 relative to infectivity at high CD4. Macrophage-tropic viruses have an enhanced ability to infect at low CD4. Using this approach we have found that macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 are relatively rare and that most HIV-1 variants require high levels of CD4 to enter cells, a phenotype we have referred to as R5 T cell-tropic.\",\"The global AIDS pandemic continues to expand and in some regions of the world, such as southern Africa, the prevalence of HIV-1 infection exceeds 20%. The devastating spread of the virus in young women in these countries appears disproportional to overall risk of infection. Regions with high prevalence of HIV-1 are often also highly endemic for other pathogenic viruses including HSV, CMV and HTLV. We propose that acquisition by HIV-1 of the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, in a process we call \\\"natural pseudotyping,\\\" expands the cellular tropism of HIV-1, enabling it to infect female genital epithelial cells directly and thereby dramatically increasing risk of infection during sexual intercourse. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that when HIV-1 co-infects T cells along with the gammaretrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), progeny HIV-1 particles are produced capable of infecting primary vaginal, ectocervical and endocervical epithelial cells. These cell types are normally resistant to HIV-1 infection. Infection of primary genital cells was neutralized by antisera against the XMRV glycoprotein, confirming that infection was mediated by the XMRV glycoprotein acquired through pseudotyping of HIV. Inhibition by AZT showed that active replication of HIV-1 occurred in these cells and ruled out non-specific endocytic uptake of the virus. These results demonstrate that natural pseudotyping can expand the tropism of HIV-1 to include genital epithelial cells and have potential implications for sexual transmission of the virus. \",\"Bst-2/Tetherin inhibits the release of HIV by tethering newly formed virus particles to the plasma membrane of infected cells. Although the mechanisms of Tetherin-mediated restriction are increasingly well understood, the biological relevance of this restriction in the natural target cells of HIV is unclear. Moreover, whether Tetherin exerts any restriction on the direct cell-cell spread of HIV across intercellular contacts remains controversial. Here we analyse the restriction endogenous Tetherin imposes on HIV transmission from primary human macrophages, one of the main targets of HIV in vivo. We find that the mRNA and protein levels of Tetherin in macrophages are comparable to those in T cells from the same donors, and are highly upregulated by type I interferons. Improved immunocytochemistry protocols enable us to demonstrate that Tetherin localises to the cell surface, the trans-Golgi network, and the macrophage HIV assembly compartments. Tetherin retains budded virions in the assembly compartments, thereby impeding the release and cell-free spread of HIV, but it is not required for the maintenance of these compartments per se. Notably, using a novel assay to quantify cell-cell spread, we show that Tetherin promotes the transfer of virus clusters from macrophages to T cells and thereby restricts the direct transmission of a dual-tropic HIV-1. Kinetic analyses provide support for the notion that this direct macrophage-T cell spread is mediated, at least in part, by so-called virological synapses. Finally, we demonstrate that the viral Vpu protein efficiently downregulates the cell surface and overall levels of Tetherin, and thereby abrogates this HIV restriction in macrophages. Together, our study shows that Tetherin, one of the most potent HIV restriction factors identified to date, can inhibit virus spread from primary macrophages, regardless of the mode of transmission. \",\"Sexual transmission is the main route of HIV-1 infection and the CCR5-using (R5) HIV-1 is predominantly transmitted, even though CXCR4-using (X4) HIV-1 is often abundant in chronic HIV-1 patients. The mechanisms underlying this tropism selection are unclear. Mucosal Langerhans cells (LCs) are the first immune cells to encounter HIV-1 and here we investigated the role of LCs in selection of R5 HIV-1 using an ex vivo epidermal and vaginal transmission models. Immature LCs were productively infected by X4 as well as R5 HIV-1. However, only R5 but not X4 viruses were selectively transmitted by immature LCs to T cells. Transmission of HIV-1 was depended on de novo production of HIV-1 in LCs, since it could be inhibited by CCR5 fusion inhibitors as well as reverse transcription inhibitors. Notably, the activation state of LCs affected the restriction in X4 HIV-1 transmission; immune activation by TNF facilitated transmission of X4 as well as R5 HIV-1. These data suggest that LCs play a crucial role in R5 selection and that immature LCs effectively restrict X4 at the level of transmission.\",\"Maraviroc, a chemokine co-receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist, has demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to efavirenz, each in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine, over 96 weeks in the Maraviroc vs. Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy (MERIT) study. Here we report 5-year findings. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase IIb/III study with an open-label extension phase. Treatment-naive patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection (Trofile) received maraviroc 300 mg twice daily or efavirenz 600 mg once daily, and zidovudine/lamivudine 300 mg/150 mg twice daily. After the last patient's week 96 visit, the study was unblinded and patients could enter a nominal 3-year open-label phase. Endpoints at the 5-year nominal visit (week 240) included proportion of patients (CCR5 tropism re-confirmed by enhanced sensitivity Trofile) with viral load (plasma HIV-1 RNA) below 50 and 400 copies/ml, and change from baseline in CD4(+) cell count, as well as safety. The proportion of patients maintaining viral load below 50 copies/ml was similar between treatment arms throughout the study and at week 240 (maraviroc 50.8% vs. efavirenz 45.9%). Maraviroc-treated patients had a greater increase from baseline in mean CD4(+) cell count than efavirenz-treated patients at week 240 (293 vs. 271 cells/\\u03bcl, respectively). Fewer patients on maraviroc vs. efavirenz experienced treatment-related adverse events (68.9 vs. 81.7%) and discontinued as a result of any adverse event (10.6 vs. 21.3%). Maraviroc maintained similar long-term antiviral efficacy to efavirenz over 5 years in treatment-naive patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Maraviroc was generally well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings or evidence of long-term safety concerns.\",\"The efficiency of CD4/CCR5 mediated HIV-1 entry has important implications for pathogenesis and transmission. The HIV-1 receptor affinity profiling (Affinofile) system analyzes and quantifies the infectivity of HIV-1 envelopes (Envs) across a spectrum of CD4/CCR5 expression levels and distills these data into a set of Affinofile metrics. The Affinofile system has shed light on how differential CD4/CCR5 usage efficiencies contributes to an array of Env phenotypes associated with cellular tropism, viral pathogenesis, and CCR5 inhibitor resistance. To facilitate more rapid, convenient, and robust analysis of HIV-1 entry phenotypes, we engineered a reporter Affinofile system containing a Tat- and Rev-dependent Gaussia luciferase-eGFP-Reporter (GGR) that is compatible with the use of pseudotyped or replication competent viruses with or without a virally encoded reporter gene. This GGR Affinofile system enabled a higher throughput characterization of CD4/CCR5 usage efficiencies associated with differential Env phenotypes. We first validated our GGR Affinofile system on isogenic JR-CSF Env mutants that differ in their affinity for CD4 and/or CCR5. We established that their GGR Affinofile metrics reflected their differential entry phenotypes on primary PBMCs and CD4+ T-cell subsets. We then applied GGR Affinofile profiling to reveal distinct entry phenotypes associated with transmission, subtype specificity, and resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs). First, we profiled a panel of reference subtype B transmitted/founder (T/F) and chronic Envs (n\\u2009=\\u200912) by analyzing the infectivity of each Env across 25 distinct combinations of CD4/CCR5 expression levels. Affinofile metrics revealed that at low CCR5 levels, our panel of subtype B T/F Envs was more dependent on high levels of CD4 for HIV-1 entry compared to chronic Envs. Next, we analyzed a reference panel of 28 acute/early subtype A-D Envs, and noted that subtype C Envs could be distinguished from the other subtypes based on their infectivity profiles and relevant Affinofile metrics. Lastly, mutations known to confer resistance to VRC01 or PG6/PG19 BNAbs, when engineered into subtypes A-D Envs, resulted in significantly decreased CD4/CCR5 usage efficiency. GGR Affinofile profiling reveals pathophysiological phenotypes associated with varying HIV-1 entry efficiencies, and highlight the fitness costs associated with resistance to some broadly neutralizing antibodies.\",\"Primate lentiviruses exhibit narrow host tropism, reducing the occurrence of zoonoses but also impairing the development of optimal animal models of AIDS. To delineate the factors limiting cross-species HIV-1 transmission, we passaged a modified HIV-1 in pigtailed macaques that were transiently depleted of CD8(+) cells during acute infection. During adaptation over four passages in macaques, HIV-1 acquired the ability to antagonize the macaque restriction factor tetherin, replicated at progressively higher levels, and ultimately caused marked CD4(+) T cell depletion and AIDS-defining conditions. Transient treatment with an antibody to CD8 during acute HIV-1 infection caused rapid progression to AIDS, whereas untreated animals exhibited an elite controller phenotype. Thus, an adapted HIV-1 can cause AIDS in macaques, and stark differences in outcome can be determined by immunological perturbations during early infection. \",\"Novel anti-Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 agents targeting the V3 loop of envelope protein gp120 were designed by computer modeling based on glycosphingolipid \\u03b2-galactosylceramide (\\u03b2-GalCer), which is an alternative receptor allowing HIV-1 entry into CD4-negative cells of neural and colonic origin. Models of these \\u03b2-GalCer analogs bound to the V3 loops from five various HIV-1 variants were generated by molecular docking and their stability was estimated by molecular dynamics (MDs) and binding free energy simulations. Specific binding to the V3 loop was accomplished primarily by non-conventional XH\\u2026\\u03c0 interactions between CH/OH sugar groups of the glycolipids and the conserved V3 residues with \\u03c0-conjugated side chains. The designed compounds were found to block the tip and/or the base of the V3 loop, which form invariant structural motifs that contain residues critical for cell tropism. With the MDs calculations, the docked models of the complexes of the \\u03b2-GalCer analogs with V3 are energetically stable in all of the cases of interest and exhibit low values of free energy of their formation. Based on the data obtained, these compounds are considered as promising basic structures for the rational design of novel, potent, and broad-spectrum anti-HIV-1 therapeutics. \",\"HIV patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy have undetectable viremia making it impossible to screen plasma HIV tropism if regimen change is required during suppression. We investigated the prevalence and predictors of tropism switch from CCR5-using (\\\"R5\\\") to non-CCR5-using (\\\"non-R5\\\") before and after viral suppression in the initially therapy-na\\u00efve HOMER cohort from British Columbia, Canada. We compared pre-therapy and post-suppression viral genotypic tropism in patients who initiated on PI/NNRTI-based antiretroviral regimens between 1996-1999 (n\\u200a=\\u200a462). Virologic suppression was defined as having two consecutive viral loads of <500 copies/mL, which was the sensitivity limit of most viral load assays at the time. Viral tropism was inferred by V3-loop-population-sequencing and geno2pheno[coreceptor] with cutoff at 5.75% false positive rate (FPR). When virologic suppression was defined as two-consecutive viral loads <500 copies/mL, 34 (9%) of the 397 patients with pre-therapy R5-virus switched to non-R5 at viral load rebound after a median of 19 months (IQR 8-41 months) of undetectable viremia. Duration of viral load suppression was not a predictor of switch, but lower CD4 count during suppression (median 400 versus 250 cells/mL) and an increased prevalence of pre-therapy non-R5 HIV by \\\"deep\\\" sequencing (median 0.2% versus 3.2%) were independently associated with switch (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.03 and p<0.0001, respectively). R5-to-non-R5 tropism switches in plasma virus after undetectable viremia were relatively rare events especially among patients with higher CD4 counts during virologic suppression. Our study supports the use of pre-suppression tropism results if maraviroc is being considered during virologic suppression in this subgroup of patients.\",\"HIV-1 coreceptor tropism testing is used to evaluate eligibility for CCR5 antagonist therapy. However, HIV-1 RNA-based tests are not suitable for virologically suppressed patients, therefore the use of proviral DNA tropism testing has been investigated. We describe a novel proviral DNA-based genotypic tropism assay and compare its performance to that of a sensitive HIV-1 RNA-based genotypic test. Tropism was determined using HIV-1 plasma RNA and proviral DNA from 42 paired samples from patients with plasma viral loads \\u22651000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. Proviral DNA sample types included whole blood, separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and peripheral blood mononuclear cells resuspended in spun plasma. The HIV-1 envelope V3 region was PCR-amplified, sequenced in triplicate, and analyzed for tropism with the geno2pheno algorithm using a 10% false-positive rate (FPR). Amplicons were obtained from proviral DNA and plasma RNA in 41/42 samples. Tropism predictions were highly concordant (93%-98%) between proviral DNA and plasma RNA, regardless of the proviral DNA isolation method. Non-R5 proviral DNA results were obtained for 100% of patients with detectable non-R5 plasma HIV-1 RNA results. Geno2pheno FPRs for proviral DNA and plasma RNA were highly correlated (Spearman rho\\u2009=\\u20090.86). Our findings demonstrate that proviral DNA tropism determinations from whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells were highly concordant with plasma HIV-1 RNA tropism determinations. This assay may be useful for screening virologically suppressed patients for CCR5-antagonist eligibility and for research purposes.\",\"Astrocytes protect neurons but also evoke a proinflammatory response to injury and viral infections including HIV. We investigated the mechanism of HIV-1 infection in primary astrocytes, which showed minimal but productive viral infection independent of CXCR4. As with ectopic-CD4-expressing astrocytes, lysosomotropic agents led to increased HIV-1 infection in wild-type but not Rabs 5, 7, and 11-ablated astrocytes. Instead, HIV-1 infection was decreased in Rab-depleted astrocytes, corroborating viral entry by endocytosis. HIV-1 produced persistent infection in astrocytes (160 days); no evidence of latent infection was seen. Notably, one caveat is that endosomal modifiers enhanced wild-type HIV-1 infection (M- and T-tropic) in astrocytes, suggesting endocytic entry of the virus. Impeding endocytosis by inhibition of Rab 5, 7 or 11 will inhibit HIV infection in astrocytes. Although the contribution of such low-level infection in astrocytes to neurological complications is unclear, it may serve as an elusive viral reservoir in the central nervous system. \",\"Generalized immune activation during HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neurocognitive disease, osteoporosis, metabolic disorders, and physical frailty. The mechanisms driving this immune activation are poorly understood, particularly for individuals effectively treated with antiretroviral medications. We hypothesized that viral characteristics such as sequence diversity may play a role in driving HIV-associated immune activation. We therefore sequenced proviral DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-infected individuals on fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We performed phylogenetic analyses, calculated viral diversity and divergence in the env and pol genes, and determined coreceptor tropism and the frequency of drug resistance mutations. Comprehensive immune profiling included quantification of immune cell subsets, plasma cytokine levels, and intracellular signaling responses in T cells, B cells, and monocytes. These antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-infected individuals exhibited a wide range of diversity and divergence in both env and pol genes. However, proviral diversity and divergence in env and pol, coreceptor tropism, and the level of drug resistance did not significantly correlate with markers of immune activation. A clinical history of virologic failure was also not significantly associated with levels of immune activation, indicating that a history of virologic failure does not inexorably lead to increased immune activation as long as suppressive antiretroviral medications are provided. Overall, this study demonstrates that latent viral diversity is unlikely to be a major driver of persistent HIV-associated immune activation. Chronic immune activation, which is associated with cardiovascular disease, neurologic disease, and early aging, is likely to be a major driver of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although treatment of HIV with antiretroviral medications decreases the level of immune activation, levels do not return to normal. The factors driving this persistent immune activation, particularly during effective treatment, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated whether characteristics of the latent, integrated HIV provirus that persists during treatment are associated with immune activation. We found no relationship between latent viral characteristics and immune activation in treated individuals, indicating that qualities of the provirus are unlikely to be a major driver of persistent inflammation. We also found that individuals who had previously failed treatment but were currently effectively treated did not have significantly increased levels of immune activation, providing hope that past treatment failures do not have a lifelong \\\"legacy\\\" impact.\",\"To track changes in the V3 env region of HIV-1 quasispecies and determine virus coreceptor use in cell reservoirs of patients on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Ten patients whose plasma viraemia had been suppressed for a median of 5.5 years were followed for 5 years. The V3 env regions of viruses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed by ultra-deep sequencing (UDS). HIV-1 tropism was predicted using the geno2pheno 5.75 algorithm and a phenotypic assay. The UDS and phenotypic assay data were concordant for predicting HIV-1 tropism. CXCR4-using viruses detected by UDS accounted for 14.7%-76.5% of the virus populations in samples from five patients at enrolment. Five patients harboured pure R5 virus populations and no X4 viruses emerged during the 5 years. The selection pressures estimated by the dN/dS ratio were acting on the V3 region to produce diversification of the quasispecies in CXCR4-infected patients and purification of the quasispecies in R5-infected patients on effective ART. UDS showed that the virus quasispecies in cell reservoirs of patients on long-term suppressive ART continued to evolve. CXCR4-using variants became more diversified. Analysis of the selection pressures on the virus quasispecies could provide a clearer picture of virus persistence in patients on effective ART.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by replication in macrophages or brain microglia that express low levels of the CD4 receptor and is the cause of HIV-associated dementia and related cognitive and motor disorders that affect 20 to 30% of treatment-naive patients with AIDS. Independent viral envelope evolution in the brain has been reported, with the need for robust replication in resident CD4(low) cells, as well as CD4-negative cells, such as astrocytes, proposed as a major selective pressure. We previously reported giant-cell encephalitis in subtype B and C R5 simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques (SHIV-induced encephalitis [SHIVE]) that experienced very high chronic viral loads and progressed rapidly to AIDS, with varying degrees of macrophage or microglia infection and activation of these immune cells, as well as astrocytes, in the CNS. In this study, we characterized envelopes (Env) amplified from the brains of subtype B and C R5 SHIVE macaques. We obtained data in support of an association between severe neuropathological changes, robust macrophage and microglia infection, and evolution to CD4 independence. Moreover, the degree of Env CD4 independence appeared to correlate with the extent of astrocyte infection in vivo. These findings further our knowledge of the CNS viral population phenotypes that are associated with the severity of HIV/SHIV-induced neurological injury and improve our understanding of the mechanism of HIV-1 cellular tropism and persistence in the brain. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of astrocytes in the brain has been suggested to be important in HIV persistence and neuropathogenesis but has not been definitively demonstrated in an animal model of HIV-induced encephalitis (HIVE). Here, we describe a new nonhuman primate (NHP) model of R5 simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-induced encephalitis (SHIVE) with several classical HIVE features that include astrocyte infection. We further show an association between severe neuropathological changes, robust resident microglia infection, and evolution to CD4 independence of viruses in the central nervous system (CNS), with expansion to infection of truly CD4-negative cells in vivo. These findings support the use of the R5 SHIVE models to study the contribution of the HIV envelope and viral clades to neurovirulence and residual virus replication in the CNS, providing information that should guide efforts to eradicate HIV from the body.\",\"Genome editing using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) has been successfully applied to disrupt CCR5 or CXCR4 host factors and inhibit viral entry and infection. Gene therapy using ZFNs to modify the PSIP1 gene, which encodes the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) protein, might restrain an early step of the viral replication cycle at the integration level. ZFNs targeting the PSIP1 gene (ZFNLEDGF) were designed to specifically recognize the sequence after the integrase binding domain (IBD) of the LEDGF/p75 protein. ZFNLEDGF successfully recognized the target region of the PSIP1 gene in TZM-bl cells by heteroduplex formation and DNA sequence analysis. Gene editing induced a frameshift of the coding region and resulted in the abolishment of LEDGF expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Functional assays revealed that infection with the HIV-1 R5 BaL or X4 NL4-3 viral strains was impaired in LEDGF/p75 knockout cells regardless of entry tropism due to a blockade in HIV-1 proviral integration into the host genome. However, residual infection was detected in the LEDGF knockout cells. Indeed, LEDGF knockout restriction was overcome at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting alternative mechanisms for HIV-1 genome integration rather than through LEDGF/p75. However, the observed residual integration was sensitive to the integrase inhibitor raltegravir. These results demonstrate that the described ZFNLEDGF effectively targets the PSIP1 gene, which is involved in the early steps of the viral replication cycle; thus, ZFNLEDGF may become a potential antiviral agent for restricting HIV-1 integration. Moreover, LEDGF knockout cells represent a potent tool for elucidating the role of HIV integration cofactors in virus replication. \",\"HIV-2 infection is characterized by low plasma viraemia and slower progression to AIDS in comparison with HIV-1 infection. However, antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV-2 is less effective and often fails to provide optimal CD4 recovery. We examined viral tropism in persons with HIV-2 infection enrolled in the HIV-2 Spanish cohort. Viral tropism was estimated based on V3 sequences obtained from plasma RNA and/or proviral DNA. From a total of 279 individuals with HIV-2 infection recorded in the Spanish national register, 58 V3 sequences belonging to 42 individuals were evaluated. X4 viruses were recognized in 14 patients (33%). Patients with X4 viruses had lower median CD4+ cell counts than patients with R5 viruses [130 (17-210) versus 359 (180-470) cells/mm(3); P\\u200a=\\u200a0.007]. This was true even considering only the subset of 19 patients on antiretroviral therapy [94 (16-147) versus 184 (43-368) cells/mm(3); P\\u200a=\\u200a0.041]. In multivariate analysis, significant differences in CD4+ cell counts between patients with X4 and R5 viruses remained after adjusting for age, gender, antiretroviral therapy and viral load. The presence of X4-tropic viruses in HIV-2 infection is associated with low CD4+ cell counts, regardless of antiretroviral treatment. Along with CD4+ cell counts, viral tropism testing may assist decisions about when to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-2-infected individuals.\",\"HIV-1 tropism needs to be determined before the use of CCR5 antagonist drugs such as maraviroc (MVC), which are ineffective against CXCR4-using HIV-1. This study assessed how different computational methods for predicting tropism from HIV sequence data performed in a large clinical cohort. The value of adding clinical data to these algorithms was also investigated. PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop region was performed on triple replicates of plasma viral RNA or proviral DNA extracted from peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) in 242 patients. Coreceptor usage was predicted from V3 sequences using seven bioinformatics interpretation algorithms, combined with clinical data where appropriate. An intention-to-treat approach was employed for exploring outcomes and performance for different viral subtypes was examined. The frequency of R5 predictions varied by 22.6%, with all seven algorithms agreeing for only 75.3% of tests. The identification of individuals likely to fail was poor for all algorithms. The addition of clinical data improved this, but at the expense of their ability to predict success. The clinical algorithms varied across subtypes, whereas other algorithms were more consistent. Furthermore, individuals with discordant clonal and clinical predictions were more likely to fail MVC treatment. Eligibility for MVC varied depending on the algorithm method used. The addition of clinical parameters alongside sequence data may help predict X4 emergence during treatment. It could be that V3 loop analysis in isolation may not be the best method for selecting individuals for MVC.\",\"The \\\"Berlin patient\\\" is the first patient cured of HIV-1 infection after allogeneic transplantation with nonfunctional CCR5 coreceptor stem cells. We demonstrate that CXCR4-predicted minority viruses present prior to transplantation were unable to rebound after transplantation due to their dependence on CCR5 for replication and high genetic barrier toward CXCR4 usage. \",\"Adequate determination of HIV-1 tropism is important in clinical and research settings. Genotypic and phenotypic approaches to evaluate tropism have been described. Phenotypic assays are widely used to determine HIV-1 tropism because of their sensitivity to detect minor CXCR4-using variants (X4). However they cannot differentiate mixed quasi-species of R5 and X4 viruses from dual-tropic viruses. We describe here a clonal-based HIV-1 tropism phenotypic assay. Env-pseudo-typed viruses were produced by co-transfection of the env expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/V5HisTOPO and a backbone vector pNL4-3.Luc.E-R- that expresses the entire HIV-1 genome except for env and vpr in 293T cell cultures. Co-receptor use was tested by infecting U87.CD4.CCR5+ and U87.CD4.CXCR4+ cells in the presence or absence of co-receptor inhibitors, using 10 clones from each sample. The ability of the assay to detect minor variants in a viral population was assessed by mixing X4 and R5 clones using different ratios. Both R5 and X4 minority variants were detected when present at greater than 0.4% in a mixture of envelope populations. This assay can be useful in both clinical and research laboratories. \",\"The HIV-1 epidemic in South America is dominated by pure subtypes (mostly B and C) and more than 7 BF and BC recombinant forms. In Argentina, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) comprised of subtypes B and F make up more than 50% of HIV infections. For this study, 28 HIV-1 primary isolates were obtained from patients in Buenos Aires, Argentina and initially classified into subtype B (n\\u200a=\\u200a9, 32.1%), C (n\\u200a=\\u200a1, 3.6%), and CRFs (n\\u200a=\\u200a18, 64.3%) using partial pol and vpu-env sequences, which proved to be inconsistent and inaccurate for these phylogenetic analyses. Near full length genome sequences of these primary HIV-1 isolates revealed that nearly all intersubtype BF recombination sites were unique and countered previous \\\"CRF\\\" B/F classifications. The majority of these Argentinean HIV-1 isolates were CCR5-using but 4 had a dual/mixed tropism as predicted by both phenotypic and genotypic assays. Comparison of the replicative fitness of these BF primary HIV-1 isolates to circulating B, F, and C HIV-1 using pairwise competitions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) indicated a similarity in fitness of these BF recombinants to subtypes B and F HIV-1 (of the same co-receptor usage) whereas subtype C HIV-1 was significantly less fit than all as previously reported. These results suggest that the multitude of BF HIV-1 strains present within the Argentinean population do not appear to have gained replicative fitness following recent B and F recombination events. \",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 subtype CRF01_AE is one of the major HIV-1 subtypes that dominate the global epidemic. However, its drug resistance, associated mutations, and viral fitness have not been systemically studied, because available chimeric simian-HIVs (SHIVs) usually express the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (rt) gene of subtype B HIV-1, which is different from subtype CRF01_AE HIV-1. In this study, a recombinant plasmid, pRT-SHIV/AE, was constructed to generate a chimeric RT-SHIV/AE by replacing the rt gene of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239) with the counterpart of Chinese HIV-1 subtype CRF01_AE. The infectivity, replication capacity, co-receptor tropism, drug sensitivity, and genetic stability of RT-SHIV/AE were characterized. The new chimeric RT-SHIV/AE effectively infected and replicated in human T cell line and rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells (rhPBMC). The rt gene of RT-SHIV/AE lacked the common mutation (T215I) associated with drug resistance. RT-SHIV-AE retained infectivity and immunogenicity, similar to that of its counterpart RT-SHIV/TC virus following intravenous inoculation in Chinese rhesus macaque. RT-SHIV-AE was more sensitive to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) than the RT-SHIV/TC. RT-SHIV/AE was genetically stable in Chinese rhesus macaque. The new chimeric RT-SHIV/AE may be a valuable tool for evaluating the efficacy of the rt-based antiviral drugs against the subtype CRF01_AE HIV-1.\",\"The world-wide HIV epidemic is characterized by increasing genetic diversity with multiple viral subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs). Antiretroviral drug design and basic virology studies have largely focused on HIV-1 subtype B. There have been few direct comparisons by subtype, perhaps due to the lack of uniform and standardized culture systems for the in vitro propagation of diverse HIV-1 subtypes. Although peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are major targets and reservoirs of HIV, PBMCs culturing is relatively difficult and not always reproducible. In addition, long-term experiments cannot be performed because PBMCs are short-lived cells. We faced these problems during the in vitro testing of an experimental RNA interference (RNAi) based gene therapy. Therefore, many T cell lines that support HIV-1 infection were tested and compared for replication of HIV-1 isolates, including viruses that use different receptors and diverse subtypes. The PM1 T cell line was comparable to PBMCs for culturing of any of the HIV-1 strains and subtypes. The advantage of PM1 cells in long-term cultures for testing the safety and efficacy of an RNAi-based gene therapy was demonstrated. PM1 may thus provide a valuable research tool for studying new anti-HIV therapies. \",\"HIV-1 tropism determination is necessary prior to CCR5 antagonist use as antiretroviral therapy. Genotypic prediction of coreceptor use is a practical alternative to phenotypic tests. Cell DNA and plasma RNA-based prediction has shown discordance in many studies. We evaluate paired cell and plasma either as single or replicate V3 sequences to assess prediction comparability. The HIV-1 partial env region was sequenced and tropism was predicted using geno2pheno and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM). Nucleotide ambiguities at V3 were quantified and genetic distance (Protdist) was determined using BioEdit. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, t tests, and Spearman correlation were performed with Prism GraphPad5.0. Results are expressed as medians, with a level of significance of p<0.05, two tailed. Single (n=28) or replicate (n=26) paired cell/plasma sequences were obtained from 54 patients. Although the clonalfalse-positive rate (FPR) value from both compartments strongly correlated (r=0.86 p<0.0001), discordance in tropism prediction was observed in both singles and replicates using geno2pheno or PSSM. Applying clonalFPR(10%) 46% (25/54) were X4 tropic, with a plasma/cell discordance of 11% in singles and 23% in replicates. Genetic distance (p<0.0001) and clonalFPR value dispersion (p=0.003) were significantly higher among replicate sequences from cells. Discordance of viral tropism prediction is not uncommon and the use of replicates does not decrease its occurrence, but improves X4 sensitivity. Sequences from provirus had greater genetic distance and dispersion of clonalFPR values. This may suggest that DNA replicate assays may better represent the diversity of HIV-1 variants, but the clinical significance of these findings needs further evaluation.\",\"It is now known that clinically derived viruses are most commonly R5 tropic with very low infectivity in macrophages. As these viruses utilize CD4 inefficiently, defective entry has been assumed to be the dominant restriction. The implication is that macrophages are not an important reservoir for the majority of circulating viruses. Macrophage infection by clinical transmitted/founder isolates was 10-100 and 30-450 fold less efficient as compared to YU-2 and BaL respectively. Vpx complementation augmented macrophage infection by non-macrophage tropic viruses to the level of infectivity observed for YU-2 in the absence of Vpx. Augmentation was evident even when Vpx was provided 24\\u00a0hours post-infection. The entry defect was measured as 2.5-5 fold, with a further 3.5-10 fold block at strong stop and subsequent stages of reverse transcription as compared to YU-2. The overall block to infection was critically dependent on the mechanism of entry as demonstrated by rescue of infection after pseudotyping with VSV-G envelope. Reverse transcription in macrophages could not be enhanced using a panel of cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although the predominant block to clinical transmitted/founder viruses is post-entry, infectivity is determined by Env-CD4 interactions and can be rescued with VSV-G pseudotyping. This suggests a functional link between the optimal entry pathway taken by macrophage tropic viruses and downstream events required for reverse transcription. Consistent with a predominantly post-entry block, replication of R5 using viruses can be greatly enhanced by Vpx. We conclude therefore that entry is not the limiting step and that macrophages represent clinically relevant reservoirs for 'non-macrophage tropic' viruses.\",\"Transmission of HIV-1 with drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in Spain remains stable around 13%. However, the profile of recent HIV-1 seroconverters has experienced significant changes. Retrospective analyses of all individuals with HIV-1 infection acquired within the past 12 months recruited at a national registry since year 1997. A total of 1032 recent HIV-1 seroconverters were examined (92.2% men; median age 31 years; 84% homosexual men). At the moment of diagnosis, median plasma HIV-RNA and CD4 cell counts were 4.5 \\u200alog copies/ml and 558 cells/\\u03bcl, respectively. A total of 136 individuals (13.8%) carried non-B subtypes. Major primary DRMs were found in 13.4%, being 7.7% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), 5.8% for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 2.9% for protease inhibitor. NRTI DRM significantly declined from 23.7% in 1997-2000 to 5.7% in 2010-2012 (P<0.01). Overall, X4 viruses were found in 19.7% of HIV-1 seroconverters, increasing from 11.5% before 2001 to 23.3% since year 2010 (P=0.04). Interestingly, median CD4 cell counts were significantly lower in seroconverters diagnosed during the last period after adjusting for potential confounders. In multivariate analyses, X4 tropism, high HIV-RNA, foreigners and non-B subtypes were independent predictors of lower CD4 cell counts. Transmission of NRTI DRM has declined significantly in recent HIV-1 seroconverters in Spain. Conversely, X4 tropic viruses are on the rise and currently account for 23.3% of new HIV-1 infections. These individuals present with lower CD4 cell counts suggesting that circulating HIV-1 strains might have gained virulence.\",\"HIV-1 entry begins with viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 interacting with host-cell CD4 and an entry coreceptor (mainly chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4). Inhibitors of particular coreceptors are being developed in order to exploit this step of cellular infection. However, effectiveness of these drugs requires matching of the administered therapeutic to coreceptor use by the viral variants infecting each patient. Patient viruses may use only CCR5 (R5), only CXCR4 (X4) or both (D/M). Most patients in early disease have R5 variants, with the presence of X4 variants increasing as disease progresses; the infecting subtype also affects the prevalence of X4 variants. Phenotypic, genotypic and clinical trial tests are in use to determine coreceptor utilization by HIV-1 variants, termed tropism, and to predict the response to entry inhibitors. Maraviroc is the only approved entry-coreceptor inhibitor and inhibits CCR5-gp120 interaction. Clinical trials of maraviroc in specific patient subgroups are elucidating the drug's role in contemporary clinical practice. Treatment failure to this and other CCR5 inhibitors has been shown to result from either outgrowth of X4 variants or through resistance mutations leading to R5 variants that are able to enter cells using drug-bound CCR5; thus, new entry inhibitors seek to circumvent this mechanism of resistance. \",\"Macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains are able to grow to high titers in human monocyte-derived macrophages. However, it was recently reported that cellular protein SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 replication in human cells of the myeloid lineage, including monocyte-derived macrophages. Here we show that degradation of SAMHD1 in monocyte-derived macrophages was associated with moderately enhanced growth of the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain. SAMHD1 degradation was induced by treating target macrophages with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) particles containing viral protein X. For undifferentiated monocytes, HIV-2 particle treatment allowed undifferentiated monocytes to be fully permissive for productive infection by the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain. In contrast, untreated monocytes were totally resistant to HIV-1 replication. These results indicated that SAMHD1 moderately restricts even a macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain in monocyte-derived macrophages, whereas the protein potently restricts HIV-1 replication in undifferentiated monocytes. \",\"Retroviral and lentiviral vector pseudotypes (based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1) have been used for stable and safe gene transfer because of their broad host ranges and high mechanical strength. In the present study, a recombinant avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) polypeptide pseudotyped with lentivirus membrane glycoproteins gp85 and gp37, HIV/env-ALV, was generated, characterized in vitro and evaluated for its ability to infect natural host cells. We optimized the newly developed micro-neutralization (MN) assay using recombinant pseudovirion HIV/env-ALV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein and well-characterized sera from chickens with confirmed ALV-J disease or virus-free controls. HIV/env-ALV could infect CEF and DF-1 but not pk15, 293FT, MDCK or VERO E6 cells, therefore demonstrating a cellular tropism similar to the wild-type ALV-J. The MN assay indicated that the IC50 values of positive sera offered a considerable advantage in both speed and accuracy. These results suggest that this pseudotyped lentivirus is a good model for studying the functions of ALV-J env and that the MN assay is a reliable serological method for assessing antibody levels in investigating the actual status of the current ALV-J epidemic. These recombinant pseudovirions may prove to be useful for studying ALV-J biology in lower biosafety level laboratory environments, and also for the detection and quantification of neutralizing antibodies to ALV-J in a manner akin to ELISA assays, but that would also be applicable to other viruses. \",\"Men who have sex with men (MSM) have recently accounted for an alarmingly increasing proportion of HIV-1 transmission in China. In order to investigate the immune status as a result of CRF01_AE infection and CXCR4 co-receptor usage in a young Shanghai-based HIV-1-infected MSM population in Shanghai, 364 HIV-1-infected MSM with average age of 22.7 years old, newly diagnosed between Jan 2009 and Jul 2013 were analyzed for CD4+T cell count, subtyping using phylogenetic analysis, and viral co-receptor tropism using Geno2pheno and webPSSM in combination. A total of 276 individuals were identified as recently infected. Subtype assignment were as follows: 176 (63.8%) CRF01_AE, 77 (27.9%) CRF07_BC, and 23 (8.3%) subtype B. Besides, 24 second-generation recombinant strains were identified. A lower CD4+T cell count at baseline survey was observed among CRF01_AE strain-infected individuals, compared to those who were infected with CRF07_BC (P<0.01). The frequency of baseline CD4+T cell count <200 was higher and the frequency of CD4 T counts >500 lower in CRF01_AE infection than CRF07_BC infection. It is worth noting that 32.4%-40.9% of CRF01_AE strain-infected individuals were predicted to carry CXCR4-tropic viruses whereas none of CRF07_BC and subtype B were found to be as CXCR4-tropic viruses (P<0.001). As could be expected CXCR4 tropism was associated with lower CD4 T counts. This study revealed that CRF01_AE strains with high frequency of CXCR4 tropism are prevailing in the young MSM population in China and could potentially cause a severe loss of CD4+T cell count and rapid disease progression. A regular surveillance of HIV-1 subtypes, CD4+T cell count and viral co-receptor usage would be greatly beneficial for effectively monitoring disease progression, improvement of antiretroviral therapy strategy and prompt intervention of transmission. \",\"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens may be needed in patients with NRTI toxicity. Maraviroc (MVC) plus ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV-r) or atazanavir is associated with slightly lower response rates than triple therapy in drug-na\\u00efve patients. No information is available on these combinations in pretreated patients. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of MVC plus DRV/r once-daily (qd) in HIV-infected pretreated patients. A retrospective cohort study including patients starting MVC 150\\u2009mg plus DRV/r 800/100\\u2009mg qd, with CCR5 tropism and no resistance mutations for DRV/r, was performed. The primary efficacy endpoint was the achievement of plasma HIV RNA <\\u200950 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL after 48 weeks. The frequency of serious adverse effects was investigated. Sixty patients were recruited to the study, of whom 48 (80%) had HIV RNA <\\u200950\\u2009copies/mL at baseline. Reasons for starting MVC plus DRV/r were: adverse effects in 38 individuals (63%), simplification in 15 (25%) and virological failure in seven (12%). The main analysis (intention to treat, noncompleter = failure) showed that 47 patients (78%) achieved HIV RNA <\\u200950 copies/mL at 48\\u2009weeks (paired comparison with baseline, P\\u2009=\\u20091.0). On-treatment analysis showed that 42 (86%) of 49 patients presented HIV RNA <\\u200950 copies/mL at 48 weeks (paired comparison with baseline, P\\u2009=\\u20091.0). Median (interquartile range) CD4 cell counts increased from 491 (301-729) to 561 (367-793) cells/\\u03bcL at 48 weeks (P\\u2009=\\u20090.013). Only one patient discontinued therapy because of adverse effects. Most individuals starting MVC plus DRV/r qd because of simplification or adverse effects maintained HIV suppression after 48 weeks of follow-up.\",\"To increase the safety and possibly efficacy of HIV-1 derived lentivectors (LVs) as an anti-cancer vaccine, we recently developed the Nanobody (Nb) display technology to target LVs to antigen presenting cells (APCs). In this study, we extend these data with exclusive targeting of LVs to conventional dendritic cells (DCs), which are believed to be the main cross-presenting APCs for the induction of a TH1-conducted antitumor immune response. The immunogenicity of these DC-subtype targeted LVs was compared to that of broad tropism, general APC-targeted and non-infectious LVs. Intranodal immunization with ovalbumin encoding LVs induced proliferation of antigen specific CD4+ T cells, irrespective of the LVs' targeting ability. However, the cytokine secretion profile of the restimulated CD4+ T cells demonstrated that general APC targeting induced a similar TH1-profile as the broad tropism LVs while transduction of conventional DCs alone induced a similar and less potent TH1 profile as the non-infectious LVs. This observation contradicts the hypothesis that conventional DCs are the most important APCs and suggests that the activation of other APCs is also meaningful. Despite these differences, all targeted LVs were able to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes, be it to a lesser extent than broad tropism LVs. Furthermore this induction was shown to be dependent on type I interferon for the targeted and non-infectious LVs, but not for broad tropism LVs. Finally we demonstrated that the APC-targeted LVs were as potent in therapy as broad tropism LVs and as such deliver on their promise as safer and efficacious LV-based vaccines. \",\"The aim of this study was to determine the coreceptor tropism by performing genotypic HIV-1 tropism testing in a cohort of patients perinatally infected with HIV-1 and exposed to antiretroviral therapy. Genotypic coreceptor tropism was determined in patients with HIV-1 RNA<100 copies/mL using PBMC samples by gp120 V3 sequencing followed by geno2pheno interpretation (set at a false positive rate [FPR] of 20%) and in patients with \\u226f100 copies/mL using plasma samples (set at a FPR of 20%), according to European guidelines. Out of 55 patients, 50 had an HIV-1 subtype B strain, and mean (SD) age was 18.2 (4.6) years. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 13 years (range, 3-23). Thirty-three (60%) patients harbored the R5 virus. At the time of the testing, the median CD4+ T lymphocyte cell count and percentage were 705 cells/mm3 (474-905) and 32.5% in group R5 and 626 cells/mm3 (450-755) and 31.7% in group X4/D-M, respectively. The nadir of CD4+ T-cell count in groups R5 and X4/D-M were 322 cells/mm3 (230-427) and 340 cells/mm3 (242-356), respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Fifteen patients had HIV-1 RNA \\u226f50 copies/mL. The median HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 DNA were comparable in both groups without a statistical difference. The study provides an overview of the prevalence of coreceptor tropism in a cohort of patients who were vertically infected with HIV-1. The high prevalence of X4/D-M-tropic strains may simply reflect the long-term exposure to HIV. \",\"The importance of the fourth variable (V4) region of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein (Env) in virus infection has not been well clarified, though the polymorphism of this region has been found to be associated with disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In the present work, we focused on the correlation between HIV-1 gp120 V4 region polymorphism and the function of the region on virus entry, and the possible mechanisms for how the V4 region contributes to virus infectivity. Therefore, we analyzed the differences in V4 sequences along with coreceptor usage preference from CCR5 to CXCR4 and examined the importance of the amino acids within the V4 region for CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic virus entry. In addition, we determined the influence of the V4 amino acids on Env expression and gp160 processing intracellularly, as well as the amount of Env on the pseudovirus surface. The results indicated that V4 tended to have a shorter length, fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS), greater evolutionary distance, and a lower negative net charge when HIV-1 isolates switched from a coreceptor usage preference for CCR5 to CXCR4. The N- and C-terminals of the HIV-1 V4 region are highly conserved and critical to maintain virus entry ability, but only the mutation at position 417 in the context of ADA (a R5-tropic HIV-1 strain) resulted in the ability to utilize CXCR4. In addition, 390L, 391F, 414I, and 416L are critical to maintain gp160 processing and maturation. It is likely that the hydrophobic properties and the electrostatic surface potential of gp120, rather than the conformational structure, greatly contribute to this V4 functionality. The findings provide information to aid in the understanding of the functions of V4 in HIV-1 entry and offer a potential target to aid in the development of entry inhibitors. \",\"In HIV/HCV co-infected patients, HIV-1 gp120 activates human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which play a key role in fibrosis pathogenesis. It is still unclear whether pro-fibrogenic effects are more attributable to X4 or R5 strains in vivo. To assess if HIV-1 X4 or R5 variants are associated with a different progression of fibrosis. A total of 105 HIV/HCV co-infected patients were submitted to gp120 sequencing on proviral DNA and classified as X4 or R5 based on g2p (20% false positive rate). The fibrosis evolution was retrospectively determined by means of APRI and FIB-4 scores at 3-month intervals from the first anti-HCV-positive test. The association of co-receptor tropism with increased fibrosis scores was evaluated by linear mixed models. X4 variants were found in 41 patients (39%). The median observation period was similar in X4 and R5 patients (17 years). No difference was observed between the two groups of patients, except for nadir CD4 which was lower in X4 compared to R5 (percentage, p=0.005, and absolute number, p=0.005). X4 and R5 patients did not significantly differ for FIB-4 and APRI score over time (p=0.5, and p=0.1, respectively). No association between HCV-RNA levels over time and co-receptor tropism was noted (p=0.9). Conversely, a significant correlation of fibrosis scores with gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, lower current CD4 count, HIV viremia and use of antiretrovirals was observed. This retrospective analysis of fibrosis evolution did not support the evidence of a differing pro-fibrogenic activity for X4 and R5 HIV-1 variants in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.\",\"Ex vivo foreskin models have demonstrated that inner foreskin is more susceptible to HIV-1 infection than outer foreskin. In the present study we characterized the compartition of HIV-1 target cells and quantified these cells in the epidermis and dermis of inner and outer foreskins using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Our data showed that the epidermis of the inner foreskin was more enriched with CD4(+) T cells and Langerhans cells (LCs), with the co-expression of CCR5 and \\u03b14\\u03b27 receptors, than the outer foreskin. Interestingly, the vast majority of CD4(+) T cells and LCs expressed CCR5, but not CXCR4, indicating that the inner foreskin might capture and transmit R5-tropic HIV strains more efficiently. In addition, lymphoid aggregates, composed of T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in the dermis, were closer to the epithelial surface in the inner foreskin than in the outer foreskin. As dendritic cells are able to capture and pass HIV particles to susceptible target cells, HIV may be able to more efficiently infect the inner foreskin by hijacking the augmented immune communication pathways in this tissue. After the inoculation of HIV-1 particles in a foreskin explant culture model, the level of p24 antigen in the supernatant from the inner foreskin was slightly higher than that from the outer foreskin, although this difference was not significant. The present study is the first to employ both CCR5 and \\u03b14\\u03b27 to identify HIV target cells in the foreskin. Our data demonstrated that the inner foreskin was more enriched with HIV target immune cells than the outer foreskin, and this tissue was structured for efficient communication among immune cells that may promote HIV transmission and replication. In addition, our data suggests the R5-tropism of HIV sexual transmission is likely shaped through the inherent receptor composition on HIV target cells in the mucosa. \",\"Recent studies have demonstrated that the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein 41 contains a series of epitopes for human monoclonal antibodies, including 2F5, Z13e1, 4E10, and 10E8, which were isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals and show broad neutralizing activities. This suggests that MPER is a good target for the development of effective HIV-1 vaccines. However, many studies have shown that it is difficult to induce antibodies with similar broad neutralizing activities using MPER-based peptide antigens. Here, we report that 10E8-like neutralizing antibodies with effective anti-HIV-1 activity were readily induced using a precisely designed conformational immunogenic peptide containing the 10E8-specific epitope. This immunogenic peptide (designated T10HE) contains a 15-mer MPER-derived 10E8-specific epitope fused to T-helper-cell epitopes from tetanus toxin (tt), which showed a significantly stabilized \\u03b1-helix structure after a series of modifications, including substitution with an (S)-\\u03b1-(2'-pentenyl) alanine containing an olefin-bearing tether and ruthenium-catalyzed olefin metathesis, compared with the unmodified T10E peptide. The stabilized \\u03b1-helix structure of T10HE did not affect its capacity to bind the 10E8 antibody, as evaluated with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance binding assay (SPR assay). The efficacies of the T10HE and T10E epitope vaccines were evaluated after a standard vaccination procedure in which the experimental mice were primed with either the T10HE or T10E immunogen and boosted with HIV-1 JRFL pseudoviruses. Higher titers of 10E8-like antibodies were induced by T10HE than that by T10E. More importantly, the antibodies induced by T10HE showed enhanced antiviral potency against HIV-1 strains with both X4 and R5 tropism and a greater degree of broad neutralizing activity than the antibodies induced by T10E. These results indicate that a 10E8-epitope-based structure-specific peptide immunogen can elicit neutralizing antibodies when used as a vaccine prime. \",\"Standardized assessments of HIV-1 vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody responses are complicated by the genetic and antigenic variability of the viral envelope glycoproteins (Envs). To address these issues, suitable reference strains are needed that are representative of the global epidemic. Several panels have been recommended previously, but no clear answers have been available on how many and which strains are best suited for this purpose. We used a statistical model selection method to identify a global panel of reference Env clones from among 219 Env-pseudotyped viruses assayed in TZM-bl cells with sera from 205 HIV-1-infected individuals. The Envs and sera were sampled globally from diverse geographic locations and represented all major genetic subtypes and circulating recombinant forms of the virus. Assays with a panel size of only nine viruses adequately represented the spectrum of HIV-1 serum neutralizing activity seen with the larger panel of 219 viruses. An optimal panel of nine viruses was selected and augmented with three additional viruses for greater genetic and antigenic coverage. The spectrum of HIV-1 serum neutralizing activity seen with the final 12-virus panel closely approximated the activity seen with subtype-matched viruses. Moreover, the final panel was highly sensitive for detection of many of the known broadly neutralizing antibodies. For broader assay applications, all 12 Env clones were converted to infectious molecular clones using a proviral backbone carrying a Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Env.IMC.LucR viruses). This global panel should facilitate highly standardized assessments of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies across multiple HIV-1 vaccine platforms in different parts of the world. An effective HIV-1 vaccine will need to overcome the extraordinary genetic variability of the virus, where most variation occurs in the viral envelope glycoproteins that are the sole targets for neutralizing antibodies. Efforts to elicit broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that will protect against infection by most circulating strains of the virus are guided in part by in vitro assays that determine the ability of vaccine-elicited antibodies to neutralize genetically diverse HIV-1 variants. Until now, little information was available on how many and which strains of the virus are best suited for this purpose. We applied robust statistical methods to evaluate a large neutralization data set and identified a small panel of viruses that are a good representation of the global epidemic. The neutralization properties of this new panel of reference strains should facilitate the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.\",\"Among the various subtypes of the M group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), clade CRF07_BC is the most prevalent in China. To date, no strong replicable CRF07_BC infectious clone has been constructed. Here we report on the construction and characterization of highly replicable infectious molecular clones from the isolate XJDC6291 of this HIV-1 subtype. Four full-length clones pXJDC2-7, pXJDC3-7, pXJDC2-6 and pXJDC3-6 were successfully produced, but only pXJDC2-7 presented detectable infectivity and replication capability. To improve the replication capability of pXJDC2-7, a 4.8 kb region spanning from the pol Integrase to nef gene of the clone was replaced by PCR products of the corresponding fragments from the original isolate XJDC6291, which produced two clones pXJDC13 and pXJDC17 that exhibited strong replication capability. The viral stocks obtained by pXJDC-13 and pXJDC-17 transfection into 293T cells replicated efficiently in human PBMCs, human primary CD4(+) T cells and displayed CCR5 tropism. Sequence alignment between pXJDC13, pXJDC17 and pXJDC2-7 suggested that polymorphisms in the V1V2 region may influence infectivity, and reverse genetic experiment showed that V1V2 polymorphisms may influence the infectivity of the clones but did not affect the replication capability at a significant level. pXJDC13 and pXJDC17 displayed strong replication capability and are the first full-length infectious clones of HIV-1 CRF07_BC clade in the world. The availability of CRF07_BC infectious clones provides a useful tool for a wide range of studies, including antiretroviral drug and vaccine research as related to this HIV subtype. \",\"Defining a macrophage-tropic phenotype for HIV-1 to assess a role in pathogenesis is complicated by the fact that HIV-1 isolates vary continuously in their ability to enter monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro, and MDMs vary in their ability to support HIV-1 entry. To overcome these limitations, we identified consistent differences in entry phenotypes between five paired blood-derived, T cell-tropic HIV-1 env genes, four of which are CCR5-using (R5) and one of which is CXCR4-using (X4), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived, R5 macrophage-tropic env genes. We performed entry assays using the CD4- and CCR5-inducible Affinofile cell line, expressing a range of CD4 levels that approximates the range from MDMs to CD4(+) T cells. The macrophage-tropic viruses were significantly better at infecting cells expressing low levels of CD4 than the T cell-tropic viruses from the same subjects, with the titration of CD4 providing a distinctive and quantitative phenotype. This difference in CD4 utilization was not due to macrophage-tropic viruses being CD4 independent. Furthermore, macrophage-tropic viruses did not differ from paired T cell-tropic viruses in their ability to use low levels of CCR5 (tpaired = -1.39; P = 0.24) or their use of an alternative conformation of CCR5. We also infected MDMs with a panel of viruses and observed that infectivity of each virus differed across four donors and between three preparations from a single donor. We concluded that the evolutionary transition from replication in T cells to that in macrophages involves a phenotypic transition to acquire the ability to infect cells expressing low levels of CD4 and that this phenotype is more reliably measured in Affinofile cells than in macrophages. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 typically infects memory T cells by using CD4 and CCR5 to enter cells. The virus evolves to infect new cell types by changing the coreceptor from CCR5 to CXCR4 to infect naive T cells or adapting to the use of low levels of CD4 to infect macrophages. However, defining the phenotype of macrophage tropism has been difficult due to inherent variability in the use of macrophages generated in culture to support entry of HIV-1. We describe the use of Affinofile cells with inducible and variable levels of CD4 to identify a signature phenotype for macrophage-tropic HIV-1. The ability to define HIV-1 variants that have evolved an entry phenotype that allows more efficient entry into cells with low levels of CD4 sets the stage for a clearer placement of these variants in HIV-associated pathogenesis. \",\"6-(cyclohexylmethyl)-5-ethyl-2-((2-oxo-2-phenylethyl)thio)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (DB-02) is a member of the newly reported synthetic anti-HIV-1 compounds dihydro-aryl/alkylsulfanyl-cyclohexylmethyl-oxopyrimidines, S-DACOs. In vitro anti-HIV-1 activity and resistance profile studies have suggested that DB-02 has very low cytotoxicity (CC50>1mM) to cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). It displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity against laboratory adapted strains and primary isolated strains including different subtypes and tropism strains (EC50s range from 2.40 to 41.8 nM). Studies on site-directed mutagenesis, genotypic resistance profiles revealed that V106A was the major resistance contributor for the compound. Molecular docking analysis showed that DB-02 located in the hydrophobic pocket with interactions of Lys101, Val106, Leu234, His235. DB-02 also showed non-antagonistic effects to four approved antiretroviral drugs. All studies indicated that DB-02 would be a potential NNRTI with low cytotoxicity and improved activity. \",\"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsmm) infection of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) is characterized by stable CD4(+) T cell counts despite high plasma levels of CCR5-tropic viruses. However, in rare instances, SIVsmm acquires CXCR4 coreceptor tropism and causes severe CD4(+) T cell depletion, albeit without clinical signs of immunodeficiency. Here, we show that CXCR4-tropic SIVsmm strains lost their ability to downmodulate TCR-CD3 by evolving unusual Nef mutations that initially reduced (I132V) and subsequently disrupted (I123L and L146F) interaction with the CD3 \\u03b6 chain. This coevolution of Env and Nef function suggests that CD3 downmodulation is advantageous for viral replication in activated CCR5(+) memory T cells, but not in resting naive CXCR4(+) T cells that have not yet undergone TCR-CD3-mediated stimulation. This may explain why HIV-1, which generally lacks the CD3 downmodulation function, commonly switches to CXCR4 usage, whereas this is extremely rare for SIV strains that have retained this Nef activity.\",\"Determination of HIV-1 co-receptor use is a necessity before initiation of a CCR5 antagonist but the longevity of a CCR5-use prediction remains unknown. Genotypic co-receptor tropism determination was performed in 225 newly diagnosed individuals consulting an AIDS Reference Centre. Samples were collected at diagnosis and at initiation of antiretroviral therapy or just before closure of the study for patients who did not initiate therapy. For individuals with a discordant tropism prediction on the two longitudinal samples, analysis of intermediate samples and single genome sequencing of proviral DNA was performed to confirm the tropism switch. Deep sequencing was done to identify minor CXCR4 or CCR5-using populations in the initial sample. Overall, tropism switches were rare (7.6%). Only a geno2pheno false positive rate of <50% at baseline was retained as predictive for a subsequent switch from CCR5-use only to predicted CXCR4-use. Minor CXCR4-using virus populations were detected in the first sample of 9 of the 14 R5-to-X4 switchers but the subsequent outgrowth of these minor populations was documented in only 3. With the current guidelines for treatment initiation at CD4(+) T cell counts of <500 cells/mm(3), co-receptor switch between diagnosis and starting antiretroviral therapy is rare. Patients with R5 viruses and a geno2pheno FPR of <50% are more prone to subsequent co-receptor switch than patients with an FPR of >50% and will need repeat tropism testing if initiation of maraviroc is considered and previous testing dates from more than a year before.\",\"Chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) inhibitors are a novel class of antiretroviral agents that are promising for treatment of patients who harbour the HIV-1 R5 strain. Data on coreceptor tropism in non-B HIV-1 subtypes are limited. We studied coreceptor tropism in HIV-1 circulating in Thailand, where CRF01_AE predominates, using a genotypic assay. We compiled V3 sequences of HIV-1 strains circulating in Thailand during 2010-2012. Coreceptor tropism was predicted based on V3 sequences using geno2pheno version 2.5 (http://coreceptor.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de). One hundred and fifty-five HIV-1-infected patients were enrolled in this study. Ninety-nine patients (63.9%) were antiretroviral-na\\u00efve, and the remainder had virological failure. The median (interquartile range) CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA were 220 (74-379) cells/\\u03bcL and 75,374 (14,127-226,686) HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, respectively. Of the sequences obtained from these patients, 119 (76.8%) were CRF01_AE and 22 (14.2%) were subtype B. At a false positive rate of < 5%, 61 (39.4%) HIV-1-infected individuals were predicted to harbour the X4 phenotype. X4 viruses were detected more frequently in the treatment-failure group compared with the treatment-na\\u00efve group (30.3 vs. 55.4%, respectively; P = 0.002). Those with CRF01_AE had a higher proportion of X4 viruses compared with non-AE subtypes (47.9 vs. 11.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). By multivariate logistic regression, CRF01_AE and treatment failure were independently associated with predicted X4 phenotype [odds ratio (OR) 7.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.57-24.50; P < 0.001, and OR 3.10; 95% CI 1.50-6.42; P = 0.002, respectively]. CRF01_AE and treatment failure are associated with the predicted X4 phenotype. In regions where CRF01_AE predominates, use of CCR5 inhibitors must be considered with caution. The phenotypic assay and its correlation with genotypes should be further investigated in CRF01_AE.\",\"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the impact on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tropism of uncontrolled virus exposure during 2 years of intermittent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The Istituto Superiore di Sanit\\u00e0-Pulsed Antiretroviral Therapy (ISS-PART) randomized study compared the outcome of 2 years of structured treatment interruptions (STIs) versus standard continuous treatment in first-line HAART responder subjects. The STI schedule consisted of five STIs of 1, 1, 2, 2, and 3 months, respectively, separated by four periods of 3-month therapy. In the present study, coreceptor tropism was assessed in 12 patients of the STI arm at different time points over a period of 2 years. Tropism was determined on DNA and RNA by V3 loop region sequencing. The Geno2pheno algorithm (false-positive rate, FPR: 20%) was used for data interpretation. At baseline, 9/12 subjects (75.0%) had CCR5-tropic viruses in their HIV. Three had a CXCR4-tropic virus. Ten patients maintained the same coreceptor in DNA after 2 years, whereas in two patients, a shift occurred (one R5-X4, one X4-R5). In a patient with an R5 virus at baseline, a transient change to X4 tropism was seen in the rebounding virus during STI. Changes in tropism were not associated with the amplitude and duration of virus exposure during STIs, residual viremia at baseline, or the development of resistance mutations in the RT region. Our preliminary results suggest that viral replication, observed after short periods of treatment interruption, is not enough to drive the evolution of HIV tropism.\",\"Myeloid cells residing in the CNS and lymphoid tissues are targets for productive HIV-1 replication, and their infection contributes to the pathological manifestations of HIV-1 infection. The Envs can adopt altered configurations to overcome entry restrictions in macrophages via a more efficient and/or altered mechanism of engagement with cellular receptors. This review highlights evidence supporting an important role for macrophages in HIV-1 pathogenesis and persistence, which need to be considered for strategies aimed at achieving a functional or sterilizing cure. We also highlight that the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV-1 tropism for macrophages are complex, involving enhanced and/or altered interactions with CD4, CCR5, and/or CXCR4, and that the nature of these interactions may depend on the anatomical location of the virus. \",\"Differently from HIV-1, HIV-2 disease progression usually takes decades without antiretroviral therapy and the majority of HIV-2 infected individuals survive as elite controllers with normal CD4\\u207a T cell counts and low or undetectable plasma viral load. Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) are thought to play a central role in HIV-2 evolution and pathogenesis. However, the dynamic of the Nab response and resulting HIV-2 escape during acute infection and their impact in HIV-2 evolution and disease progression remain largely unknown. Our objective was to characterize the Nab response and the molecular and phenotypic evolution of HIV-2 in association with Nab escape in the first years of infection in two children infected at birth. CD4\\u207a T cells decreased from about 50% to below 30% in both children in the first five years of infection and the infecting R5 viruses were replaced by X4 viruses within the same period. With antiretroviral therapy, viral load in child 1 decreased to undetectable levels and CD4+ T cells recovered to normal levels, which have been sustained at least until the age of 12. In contrast, viral load increased in child 2 and she progressed to AIDS and death at age 9. Beginning in the first year of life, child 1 raised high titers of antibodies that neutralized primary R5 isolates more effectively than X4 isolates, both autologous and heterologous. Child 2 raised a weak X4-specific Nab response that decreased sharply as disease progressed. Rate of evolution, nucleotide and amino acid diversity, and positive selection, were significantly higher in the envelope of child 1 compared to child 2. Rates of R5-to-X4 tropism switch, of V1 and V3 sequence diversification, and of convergence of V3 to a \\u03b2-hairpin structure were related with rate of escape from the neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggests that the molecular and phenotypic evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 envelope are related with the dynamics of the neutralizing antibody response providing further support for a model in which Nabs play an important role in HIV-2 pathogenesis.\",\"HIV quasispecies was analysed in plasma and proviral genomes hosted by duodenal mucosa and peripheral blood cells (PBMC) from patients with early or chronic infection, with respect to viral heterogeneity, tropism compartmentalization and extent of immune activation. Seventeen HIV-1-infected combined antiretroviral therapy naive patients were enrolled (11 early infection and six chronic infection). V3 and nef genomic regions were analysed by ultra-deep pyrosequencing. Sequences were used to infer co-receptor usage and to construct phylogenetic trees. As markers of immune activation, plasma sCD14 and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor II (sTNFRII) levels were measured. Median diversity of HIV RNA was lower in patients with early infection versus chronic infection patients. Overall, direct correlation was observed between V3 diversity and X4 frequency; V3 diversity of HIV RNA was inversely correlated with CD4 T-cell count; median sCD14 and sTNFRII values were similar in early and chronic patients, but X4 frequency of HIV RNA was directly correlated with plasma sCD14. The proportion of patients harbouring X4 variants and median intra-patient X4 frequency of proviral genomes tended to be higher in chronic infection than early infection patients. More pronounced compartmentalization of proviral quasispecies in gut compared with PBMC samples was observed in patients with early infection compared with chronic patients. The loss of gut/PBMC compartmentalization in more advanced stages of HIV infection was confirmed by longitudinal observation. More studies are needed to understand the pathogenetic significance of early HIV quasispecies compartmentalization and progressive intermixing of viral variants in subsequent phases of the infection, as well as the role of immune activation in tropism switch. \",\"The ability to deliver a large transgene efficiently to photoreceptors using viral vectors remains problematic and yet is critical for the future therapy of inherited retinal diseases such as Stargardt's and Usher's 1B. Herein, we examine the ocular tropism of a HIV-1-based lentivirus vector pseudotyped with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus-derived glycoprotein (VEEV-G) after intraocular delivery to the posterior and anterior chambers of C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Reporter gene (EGFP) expression was evaluated using in vivo fluorescence imaging followed by postmortem immunohistochemistry and retinal function assessed by electroretinography. Intracameral administration of VEEV-G and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped vectors resulted in robust transgene expression in the corneal endothelium and trabecular meshwork. After subretinal administration, onset of transgene expression was observed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 1 day postinjection with both VEEV-G and control VSV-G pseudotypes, but no significant photoreceptor transduction was apparent. Substantial degeneration of the outer nuclear layer was observed with VEEV-G-pseudotyped vector, which corresponded to ablation of retinal function. Subretinal administration of VSV-G was observed to result in significant suppression of electrophysiological function compared with buffer-injected and uninjected control eyes. Suppression of the c-wave amplitude, in addition to reduced RPE65 expression, indicated potential RPE dysfunction. Ex vivo tropism of VSV-G was assessed using organotypic culture of explanted retina harvested from wild-type mice and human patients undergoing retinal detachment surgery to examine the prevention of transduction by physical barriers and species differences in tropism.\",\"Coreceptor switch from CCR5 to CXCR4 is associated with HIV disease progression. To document the evolution of coreceptor tropism during pregnancy, a longitudinal study of envelope gene sequences was performed in a group of pregnant women infected with HIV-1 of clade B (n=10) or non-B (n=9). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the V1-V3 region was performed on plasma viral RNA, followed by cloning and sequencing. Using geno2pheno and PSSMX4R5, the presence of X4 variants was predicted in nine of 19 subjects (X4 subjects) independent of HIV-1 clade. Six of nine X4 subjects exhibited CD4(+) T cell counts <200 cells/mm(3), and the presence of X4-capable virus was confirmed using a recombinant phenotypic assay in four of seven cases where testing was successful. In five of nine X4 subjects, a statistically significant decline in the geno2pheno false-positive rate was observed during the course of pregnancy, invariably accompanied by progressive increases in the PSSMX4R5 score, the net charge of V3, and the relative representation of X4 sequences. Evolution toward X4 tropism was also echoed in the primary structure of V2, as an accumulation of substitutions associated with CXCR4 tropism was seen in X4 subjects. Results from these experiments provide the first evidence of the ongoing evolution of coreceptor utilization from CCR5 to CXCR4 during pregnancy in a significant fraction of HIV-infected women. These results inform changes in host-pathogen interactions that lead to a directional shaping of viral populations and viral tropism during pregnancy, and provide insights into the biology of HIV transmission from mother to child.\",\"Diversification of antiretroviral factors during host evolution has erected formidable barriers to cross-species retrovirus transmission. This phenomenon likely protects humans from infection by many modern retroviruses, but it has also impaired the development of primate models of HIV-1 infection. Indeed, rhesus macaques are resistant to HIV-1, in part due to restriction imposed by the TRIM5\\u03b1 protein (rhTRIM5\\u03b1). Initially, we attempted to derive rhTRIM5\\u03b1-resistant HIV-1 strains using two strategies. First, HIV-1 was passaged in engineered human cells expressing rhTRIM5\\u03b1. Second, a library of randomly mutagenized capsid protein (CA) sequences was screened for mutations that reduced rhTRIM5\\u03b1 sensitivity. Both approaches identified several individual mutations in CA that reduced rhTRIM5\\u03b1 sensitivity. However, neither approach yielded mutants that were fully resistant, perhaps because the locations of the mutations suggested that TRIM5\\u03b1 recognizes multiple determinants on the capsid surface. Moreover, even though additive effects of various CA mutations on HIV-1 resistance to rhTRIM5\\u03b1 were observed, combinations that gave full resistance were highly detrimental to fitness. Therefore, we employed an 'assisted evolution' approach in which individual CA mutations that reduced rhTRIM5\\u03b1 sensitivity without fitness penalties were randomly assorted in a library of viral clones containing synthetic CA sequences. Subsequent passage of the viral library in rhTRIM5\\u03b1-expressing cells resulted in the selection of individual viral species that were fully fit and resistant to rhTRIM5\\u03b1. These viruses encoded combinations of five mutations in CA that conferred complete or near complete resistance to the disruptive effects of rhTRIM5\\u03b1 on incoming viral cores, by abolishing recognition of the viral capsid. Importantly, HIV-1 variants encoding these CA substitutions and SIV(mac239) Vif replicated efficiently in primary rhesus macaque lymphocytes. These findings demonstrate that rhTRIM5\\u03b1 is difficult to but not impossible to evade, and doing so should facilitate the development of primate models of HIV-1 infection.\",\"HIV coreceptor usage of CXCR4 (X4) is associated with decreased CD4+ T-cell counts and accelerated disease progression, but the role of X4 tropism in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) has not previously been described. This longitudinal study evaluated data on 197 visits from 72 recently HIV-infected persons who had undergone up to four sequential neurocognitive assessments over a median of 160 days (IQR, 138\\u2013192). Phenotypic tropism testing (Trofile ES, Monogram, Biosciences) was performed on stored blood samples. Multivariable mixed model repeated measures regression was used to determine the association between HAND and dual-mixed (DM) viral tropism, estimated duration of infection (EDI), HIV RNA, CD4 count, and problematic methamphetamine use. Six subjects (8.3 %) had DM at their first neurocognitive assessment and four converted to DM in subsequent sampling (for total of 10 DM) at a median EDI of 10.1 months (IQR, 7.2\\u201312.2). There were 44 (61.1 %) subjects who demonstrated HAND on at least one study visit. HAND was associated with DM tropism (odds ratio, 4.4; 95 % CI, 0.9\\u201320.5) and shorter EDI (odds ratio 1.1 per month earlier; 95 % CI, 1.0\\u20131.2). This study found that recency of HIV-1 infection and the development of DM tropism may be associated with HAND in the relatively early stage of infection. Together, these data suggest that viral interaction with cellular receptors may play an important role in the early manifestation of HAND.\",\"A dual split reporter protein system (DSP), recombining Renilla luciferase (RL) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) split into two different constructs (DSP1-7 and DSP8-11), was adapted to create a novel rapid phenotypic tropism assay (PTA) for HIV-1 infection (DSP-Pheno). DSP1-7 was stably expressed in the glioma-derived NP-2 cell lines, which expressed CD4/CXCR4 (N4X4) or CD4/CCR5 (N4R5), respectively. An expression vector with DSP8-11 (pRE11) was constructed. The HIV-1 envelope genes were subcloned in pRE11 (pRE11-env) and transfected into 293FT cells. Transfected 293FT cells were incubated with the indicator cell lines independently. In developing the assay, we selected the DSP1-7-positive clones that showed the highest GFP activity after complementation with DSP8-11. These cell lines, designated N4R5-DSP1-7, N4X4-DSP1-7 were used for subsequent assays. The env gene from the reference strains (BaL for R5 virus, NL4-3 for X4 virus, SF2 for dual tropic virus) subcloned in pRE11 and tested, was concordant with the expected co-receptor usage. Assay results were available in two ways (RL or GFP). The assay sensitivity by RL activity was comparable with those of the published phenotypic assays using pseudovirus. The shortest turnaround time was 5 days after obtaining the patient's plasma. All clinical samples gave positive RL signals on R5 indicator cells in the fusion assay. Median RLU value of the low CD4 group was significantly higher on X4 indicator cells and suggested the presence of more dual or X4 tropic viruses in this group of patients. Comparison of representative samples with Geno2Pheno [co-receptor] assay was concordant. A new cell-fusion-based, high-throughput PTA for HIV-1, which would be suitable for in-house studies, was developed. Equipped with two-way reporter system, RL and GFP, DSP-Pheno is a sensitive test with short turnaround time. Although maintenance of cell lines and laboratory equipment is necessary, it provides a safe assay system without infectious viruses. With further validation against other conventional analyses, DSP-Pheno may prove to be a useful laboratory tool. The assay may be useful especially for the research on non-B subtype HIV-1 whose co-receptor usage has not been studied much.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C (C-HIV) is spreading rapidly and is now responsible for >50% of HIV-1 infections worldwide, and >95% of infections in southern Africa and central Asia. These regions are burdened with the overwhelming majority of HIV-1 infections, yet we know very little about the pathogenesis of C-HIV. In addition to CCR5 and CXCR4, the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) may engage a variety of alternative coreceptors for entry into transfected cells. Whilst alternative coreceptors do not appear to have a broad role in mediating the entry of HIV-1 into primary cells, characterizing patterns of alternative coreceptor usage in vitro can provide valuable insights into mechanisms of Env-coreceptor engagement that may be important for HIV-1 pathogenesis. Here, we characterized the ability of luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with HIV-1 Envs (n = 300) cloned sequentially from plasma of 21 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na\\u00efve subjects experiencing progression from chronic to advanced C-HIV infection over an approximately 3-year period, who either exclusively maintained CCR5-using (R5) variants (n = 20 subjects) or who experienced a coreceptor switch to CXCR4-using (X4) variants (n = 1 subject), to utilize alternative coreceptors for entry. At a population level, CCR5 usage by R5 C-HIV Envs was strongly linked to usage of FPRL1, CCR3 and CCR8 as alternative coreceptors, with the linkages to FPRL1 and CCR3 usage becoming statistically more robust as infection progressed from chronic to advanced stages of disease. In contrast, acquisition of an X4 Env phenotype at advanced infection was accompanied by a dramatic loss of FPRL1 usage. Env mutagenesis studies confirmed a direct link between CCR5 and FPRL1 usage, and showed that the V3 loop crown, but not other V3 determinants of CCR5-specificity, was the principal Env determinant governing the ability of R5 C-HIV Envs from one particular subject to engage FPRL1. Our results suggest that, in the absence of coreceptor switching, the ability of R5 C-HIV viruses to engage certain alternative coreceptors in vitro, in particular FPRL1, may reflect an altered use of CCR5 that is selected for during progressive C-HIV infection, and which may contribute to C-HIV pathogenicity.\",\"The emergence of resistance against current antiretroviral drugs to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an increasingly important concern to the continuous success of antiretroviral therapy to HIV-1-infected patients. In the past decade, a number of studies reported that the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed patients has reached an overall 9% prevalence worldwide. Also, a number of studies using longitudinal HIV-1 patient study cohorts demonstrated that the cellular HIV-1 DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has a prognostic value for the progression of HIV-1 disease independently of plasma HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 count. Using a previously established molecular-beacon-based real-time PCR methodology, cellular HIV-1 DNA levels were quantified in newly diagnosed and antiretroviral-naive patients in Northern Greece recruited between 2009 and 2010 using a predefined enrolling strategy, in an effort to investigate whether there is any relationship between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance. As part of the same study, DNA sequences encoding the env (C2-C5 region of gp120) were also amplified from PBMC-extracted DNA in order to determine the genotypic coreceptor tropism and genetic subtype. Cellular HIV-1 DNA levels had a median of 3.309 log10 HIV-1 copies per 10(6) PBMCs and demonstrated no correlation between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance. An absence of association between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels with plasma viral HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 levels was also found reconfirming the previously published study. Genotypic analysis of coreceptor tropism indicated that 96% of samples, independently of the presence or not of genotypic drug resistance, were CCR5-tropic. Overall, the findings reconfirmed the previously proposed proposition that transmitted drug resistance does not have an impact on disease progression in HIV-1-infected individuals. Also, CCR5 coreceptor tropism dominance suggests that both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains behave similarly in early infection in newly diagnosed patients.\",\"HIV-1 enters the central nervous system by passing the blood-brain barrier during primary infection. Despite the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders remains high and is probably related to ongoing viral neuropathological processes. The central nervous system forms a distinct physiological, cellular, and pharmacological environment. We aimed to systematically review whether the central nervous system also constitutes a distinct virological compartment, allowing differential genotypic evolution of HIV-1. Only original research papers that compared paired plasma/cerebrospinal fluid samples for drug resistance associated mutations as defined by the IAS-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Panel or compared viral envelope (env) patterns or coreceptor prediction were included. If available, HIV RNA levels were included in the analysis, with a relevant difference defined as 0.5 log10 copies/ml. Data from 35 reports with heterogeneous study design and methods was pooled and statistical analysis was performed as appropriate. A total of 555 subjects with 671 samples could be included in this review. We observed that compartmentalization of the central nervous system occurs frequently as reflected by differences in HIV viral load, resistance associated mutations, and viral coreceptor tropism preference. \",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in macaque cells is restricted mainly by antiviral cellular APOBEC3, TRIM5\\u03b1/TRIM5CypA, and tetherin proteins. For basic and clinical HIV-1/AIDS studies, efforts to construct macaque-tropic HIV-1 (HIV-1mt) have been made by us and others. Although rhesus macaques are commonly and successfully used as infection models, no HIV-1 derivatives suitable for in vivo rhesus research are available to date. In this study, to obtain novel HIV-1mt clones that are resistant to major restriction factors, we altered Gag and Vpu of our best HIV-1mt clone described previously. First, by sequence- and structure-guided mutagenesis, three amino acid residues in Gag-capsid (CA) (M94L/R98S/G114Q) were found to be responsible for viral growth enhancement in a macaque cell line. Results of in vitro TRIM5\\u03b1 susceptibility testing of HIV-1mt carrying these substitutions correlated well with the increased viral replication potential in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with different TRIM5 alleles, suggesting that the three amino acids in HIV-1mt CA are involved in the interaction with TRIM5\\u03b1. Second, we replaced the transmembrane domain of Vpu of this clone with the corresponding region of simian immunodeficiency virus SIVgsn166 Vpu. The resultant clone, MN4/LSDQgtu, was able to antagonize macaque but not human tetherin, and its Vpu effectively functioned during viral replication in a macaque cell line. Notably, MN4/LSDQgtu grew comparably to SIVmac239 and much better than any of our other HIV-1mt clones in rhesus macaque PBMCs. In sum, MN4/LSDQgtu is the first HIV-1 derivative that exhibits resistance to the major restriction factors in rhesus macaque cells. \",\"Technically, HIV-1 tropism can be evaluated in plasma or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). However, only tropism testing of plasma HIV-1 has been validated as a tool to predict virological response to CCR5 antagonists in clinical trials. The preferable tropism testing strategy in subjects with undetectable HIV-1 viremia, in whom plasma tropism testing is not feasible, remains uncertain. We designed a proof-of-concept study including 30 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals who achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL during at least 2 years after first-line ART initiation. First, we determined the diagnostic accuracy of 454 and population sequencing of gp120 V3-loops in plasma and PBMCs, as well as of MT-2 assays before ART initiation. The Enhanced Sensitivity Trofile Assay (ESTA) was used as the technical reference standard. 454 sequencing of plasma viruses provided the highest agreement with ESTA. The accuracy of 454 sequencing decreased in PBMCs due to reduced specificity. Population sequencing in plasma and PBMCs was slightly less accurate than plasma 454 sequencing, being less sensitive but more specific. MT-2 assays had low sensitivity but 100% specificity. Then, we used optimized 454 sequence data to investigate viral evolution in PBMCs during viremia suppression and only found evolution of R5 viruses in one subject. No de novo CXCR4-using HIV-1 production was observed over time. Finally, Slatkin-Maddison tests suggested that plasma and cell-associated V3 forms were sometimes compartmentalized. The absence of tropism shifts during viremia suppression suggests that, when available, testing of stored plasma samples is generally safe and informative, provided that HIV-1 suppression is maintained. Tropism testing in PBMCs may not necessarily produce equivalent biological results to plasma, because the structure of viral populations and the diagnostic performance of tropism assays may sometimes vary between compartments. Thereby, proviral DNA tropism testing should be specifically validated in clinical trials before it can be applied to routine clinical decision-making.\",\"Characterization of HIV-1 sequences in newly infected individuals is important for elucidating the mechanisms of viral sexual transmission. We report the identification of transmitted/founder viruses in eight pairs of HIV-1 sexually-infected patients enrolled at the time of primary infection (\\\"recipients\\\") and their transmitting partners (\\\"donors\\\"). Using a single genome-amplification approach, we compared quasispecies in donors and recipients on the basis of 316 and 376 C2V5 env sequences amplified from plasma viral RNA and PBMC-associated DNA, respectively. Both DNA and RNA sequences indicated very homogeneous viral populations in all recipients, suggesting transmission of a single variant, even in cases of recent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in donors (n\\u200a=\\u200a2) or recipients (n\\u200a=\\u200a3). In all pairs, the transmitted/founder virus was derived from an infrequent variant population within the blood of the donor. The donor variant sequences most closely related to the recipient sequences were found in plasma samples in 3/8 cases and/or in PBMC samples in 6/8 cases. Although donors were exclusively (n\\u200a=\\u200a4) or predominantly (n\\u200a=\\u200a4) infected by CCR5-tropic (R5) strains, two recipients were infected with highly homogeneous CXCR4/dual-mixed-tropic (X4/DM) viral populations, identified in both DNA and RNA. The proportion of X4/DM quasispecies in donors was higher in cases of X4/DM than R5 HIV transmission (16.7-22.0% versus 0-2.6%), suggesting that X4/DM transmission may be associated with a threshold population of X4/DM circulating quasispecies in donors. These suggest that a severe genetic bottleneck occurs during subtype B HIV-1 heterosexual and homosexual transmission. Sexually-transmitted/founder virus cannot be directly predicted by analysis of the donor's quasispecies in plasma and/or PBMC. Additional studies are required to fully understand the traits that confer the capacity to transmit and establish infection, and determine the role of concomitant STIs in mitigating the genetic bottleneck in mucosal HIV transmission.\",\"Dual/mixed-tropic HIV-1 strains are predominant in a significant proportion of patients, though little information is available regarding their replication-capacity and susceptibility against CCR5-antagonists in-vitro. The aim of the study was to analyze the replication-capacity and susceptibility to maraviroc of HIV-1 clinical isolates with different tropism characteristics in primary monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDM), peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMC), and CD4(+) T-lymphocytes. Twenty-three HIV-1 isolates were phenotipically and genotipically characterized as R5, X4 or dual (discriminated as R5(+)/X4, R5/X4, R5/X4(+)). Phenotypic-tropism was evaluated by multiple-cycles-assay on U87MG-CD4(+)-CCR5(+)-/CXCR4(+)-expressing cells. Genotypic-tropism prediction was obtained using Geno2Pheno-algorithm (false-positive-rate [FPR]\\u200a=\\u200a10%). Replication-capacity and susceptibility to maraviroc were investigated in human-primary MDM, PBMC and CD4(+) T-cells. AMD3100 was used as CXCR4-inhibitor. Infectivity of R5/Dual/X4-viruses in presence/absence of maraviroc was assessed also by total HIV-DNA, quantified by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction. Among 23 HIV-1 clinical isolates, phenotypic-tropism-assay distinguished 4, 17 and 2 viruses with R5-tropic, dual/mixed-, and X4-tropic characteristics, respectively. Overall, viruses defined as R5(+)/X4-tropic were found with the highest prevalence (10/23, 43.5%). The majority of isolates efficiently replicated in both PBMC and CD4(+) T-cells, regardless of their tropism, while MDM mainly sustained replication of R5- or R5(+)/X4-tropic isolates; strong correlation between viral-replication and genotypic-FPR-values was observed in MDM (rho\\u200a=\\u200a0.710;p-value\\u200a=\\u200a1.4e-4). In all primary cells, maraviroc inhibited viral-replication of isolates not only with pure R5- but also with dual/mixed tropism (mainly R5(+)/X4 and, to a lesser extent R5/X4 and R5/X4(+)). Finally, no main differences by comparing the total HIV-DNA with the p24-production in presence/absence of maraviroc were found. Maraviroc is effective in-vitro against viruses with dual-characteristics in both MDM and lymphocytes, despite the potential X4-mediated escape. This suggests that the concept of HIV-entry through one of the two coreceptors \\\"separately\\\" may require revision, and that the use of CCR5-antagonists in patients with dual/mixed-tropic viruses may be a therapeutic-option that deserves further investigations in different clinical settings.\",\"To determine if tropism for CXCR4 or CCR5 correlates with cellular HIV DNA load, residual viraemia and CD4 count in 219 successfully treated naive subjects with HIV infection enrolled in five infectious diseases units in Northeastern Italy. A subset of subjects, achieving plasma HIV RNA level <50 copies/ml after initiation of first-line therapy and maintaining it until follow-up time points, was retrospectively selected from a prospective cohort. Blood samples were collected before the beginning of therapy (T0), at the first follow-up time (T1) and, when available, at a second (T2) follow-up time. HIV DNA, CD4 count and plasma viraemia were available from all 219 patients at T0 and T1, and in 86 subjects at T2, while tropism determinations were available from 109 subjects at T0, 219 at T1, and from 86 subjects at T2. Achieving residual viraemia <2.5 copies/ml at T1 correlated with having the same condition at T2 (p = 0.0007). X4 tropism at T1 was negatively correlated with the possibility of achieving viraemia<2.5 copies/ml at T2 (p = 0.0076). T1-T2 tropism stability was significant (p <0.0001). T0 tropism correlated with T1 and T2 tropism (p < 0.001); therefore the stability of the tropism over the two follow-up periods was significant (p = 0.0003). An effective viremic suppression (viraemia<2.5 copies/ml) correlated with R5 coreceptor affinity (p= 0.047). The tropism of archived virus was stable during an effective treatment, with 15-18% of subjects switching over time, despite a viraemia<50 copies/ml. R5 tropism and its stability were related to achieving and maintaining viraemia<2.5 copies/ml.\",\"HIV-1 pathogenesis is intimately linked with microbial infections and innate immunity during all stages of the disease. While the impact of microbial-derived products in transmission of R5-using virus to CD4(+) T cells by dendritic cells (DCs) has been addressed before, very limited data are available on the effect of such compounds on DC-mediated dissemination of X4-tropic variant. Here, we provide evidence that treatment of DCs with dectin-1/TLR2 and NOD2 ligands increases cis-infection of autologous CD4(+) T cells by X4-using virus. This phenomenon is most likely associated with an enhanced permissiveness of DCs to productive infection with X4 virus, which is linked to increased surface expression of CXCR4 and the acquisition of a maturation profile by DCs. The ensuing DC maturation enhances susceptibility of CD4(+) T cells to productive infection with HIV-1. This study highlights the crucial role of DCs at different stages of HIV-1 infection and particularly in spreading of viral strains displaying a X4 phenotype. \",\"Most HIV-1 infections are thought to occur at mucosal surfaces during sexual contact. It has been hypothesized that vaccines delivered at mucosal surfaces may mediate better protection against HIV-1 than vaccines that are delivered systemically. To test this, rhesus macaques were vaccinated by intramuscular (i.m.) or intravaginal (ivag.) routes with helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors expressing HIV-1 envelope. Macaques were first immunized intranasally with species C Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) prior to serotype-switching with species C HD-Ad6, Ad1, Ad5, and Ad2 vectors expressing env followed by rectal challenge with CCR5-tropic SHIV-SF162P3. Vaccination by the systemic route generated stronger systemic CD8 T cell responses in PBMC, but weaker mucosal responses. Conversely, mucosal immunization generated stronger CD4 T cell central memory (Tcm) responses in the colon. Intramuscular immunization generated higher levels of env-binding antibodies, but neither produced neutralizing or cytotoxic antibodies. After mucosal SHIV challenge, both groups controlled SHIV better than control animals. However, more animals in the ivag. group had lower viral set points than in in the i.m. group. These data suggest mucosal vaccination may have improve protection against sexually-transmitted HIV. These data also demonstrate that helper-dependent Ad vaccines can mediate robust vaccine responses in the face of prior immunity to Ad5 and during four rounds of adenovirus vaccination. \",\"To study the dose-dependent manner of HIV-1 Tat-induced effects on viral replication, internalization and spread, and to directly observe these effects on soluble Env immunogens and virus-like particles. In order to determine the manner through which Tat affects viral replication, we incubated cells, virions and soluble Env spikes with Tat at different concentrations, and directly visualized the effects of such incubation. Cell-based infectivity assays were carried out to assay Tat dose-dependency of viral infectivity. Transmission electron microscopy of virus-like particles and soluble gp140 immunogens incubated with Tat at various concentrations was performed to directly observe Tat-induced effects. Treating virus with exogenous Tat increased infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of anti-Tat antibodies, virus replication and spread were repressed, postulating Tat contributions to disease progression. When CXCR4 coreceptors were blocked, Tat treatment overcame the inhibition relative to absence of Tat treatment. Similarly, syncytium formation between chronically infected and uninfected target cells was also increased by exogenous Tat treatment. Inhibiting the CD4 receptor for virus entry abolished syncytium formation and Tat treatment was unable to overcome CD4 dependency. We show that Tat reduces virus infectivity at higher Tat concentrations through Env interactions resulting in viral aggregation. Treating virions or chronically infected cells with exogenous Tat could enhance virus infectivity and spread through coreceptor tropism switch or through another undetermined mechanism. The aggregation potential of Tat suggests a mechanism of negative-feedback regulation of viral replication, providing another regulative function to control viral replication.\",\"Increasing evidence indicates that the host range of primate lentiviruses is in part determined by their ability to counteract innate restriction factors that are effectors of the type 1 interferon (IFN-1) response. For human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), in vitro experiments have shown that its tropism may be narrow and limited to humans and chimpanzees because its replication in other non-human primate species is hindered by factors such as TRIM5\\u03b1 (tripartite motif 5 alpha), APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3), and tetherin. Based on these data, it has been hypothesized that primate lentiviruses will infect and replicate in a new species if they are able to counteract and evade suppression by the IFN-1 response. Several studies have tested whether engineering HIV-1 recombinants with minimal amounts of simian immunodeficiency virus sequences would enable replication in CD4(+) T cells of non-natural hosts such as Asian macaques and proposed that infection of these macaque species could be used to study transmission and pathogenesis. Indeed, infection of macaques with these viruses revealed that Vif-mediated counteraction of APOBEC3G function is central to cross-species tropism but that other IFN-induced factors may also play important roles in controlling replication. Further studies of these macaque models of infection with HIV-1 derivatives could provide valuable insights into the interaction of lentiviruses and the innate immune response and how lentiviruses adapt and cause disease. \",\"CD4(+) T cells rather than macrophages are the principal cells infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in vivo. Macrophage tropism has been linked to the ability to enter cells through CCR5 in conjunction with limiting CD4 levels, which are much lower on macrophages than on T cells. We recently reported that rhesus macaques (RM) experimentally depleted of CD4(+) T cells before SIV infection exhibit extensive macrophage infection as well as high chronic viral loads and rapid progression to AIDS. Here we show that early-time-point and control Envs were strictly CD4 dependent but that, by day 42 postinfection, plasma virus of CD4(+) T cell-depleted RM was dominated by Envs that mediate efficient infection using RM CCR5 independently of CD4. Early-time-point and control RM Envs were resistant to neutralization by SIV-positive (SIV(+)) plasma but became sensitive if preincubated with sCD4. In contrast, CD4-independent Envs were highly sensitive to SIV(+) plasma neutralization. However, plasma from SIV-infected CD4(+) T cell-depleted animals lacked this CD4-inducible neutralizing activity and failed to neutralize any Envs regardless of sCD4 pre-exposure status. Enhanced sensitivity of CD4-independent Envs from day 42 CD4(+) T cell-depleted RM was also seen with monoclonal antibodies that target both known CD4-inducible and other Env epitopes. CD4 independence and neutralization sensitivity were both conferred by Env amino acid changes E84K and D470N that arose independently in multiple animals, with the latter introducing a potential N-linked glycosylation site within a predicted CD4-binding pocket of gp120. Thus, the absence of CD4 T cells results in failure to produce antibodies that neutralize CD4-independent Envs and CD4-pretriggered control Envs. In the absence of this constraint and with a relative paucity of CD4(+) target cells, widespread macrophage infection occurs in vivo accompanied by emergence of variants carrying structural changes that enable entry independently of CD4. \",\"HIV-1 DNA in blood monocytes is considered a viral source of various HIV-1 infected tissue macrophages, which is also known as \\\"Trojan horse\\\" hypothesis. However, whether these DNA can produce virions has been an open question for years, due to the inability of isolating high titer and infectious HIV-1 directly from monocytes. In this study, we demonstrated successful isolation of two strains of M-HIV-1 (1690 M and 1175 M) from two out of four study subjects, together with their in vivo controls, HIV-1 isolated from CD4+ T-cells (T-HIV-1), 1690 T and 1175 T. All M- and T- HIV-1 isolates were detected CCR5-tropic. Both M- HIV-1 exhibited higher levels of replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) than the two T- HIV-1. Consistent with our previous reports on the subject 1175 with late infection, compartmentalized env C2-V3-C3 sequences were identified between 1175 M and 1175 T. In contrast, 1690 M and 1690 T, which were isolated from subject 1690 with relatively earlier infection, showed homogenous env C2-V3-C3 sequences. However, multiple reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor resistance-associated variations were detected in the Gag-Pol region of 1690 M, but not of 1690 T. By further measuring HIV DNA intracellular copy numbers post-MDM infection, 1690 M was found to have significantly higher DNA synthesis efficiency than 1690 T in macrophages, indicating a higher RT activity, which was confirmed by AZT inhibitory assays. These results suggested that the M- and T- HIV-1 are compartmentalized in the two study subjects, respectively. Therefore, we demonstrated that under in vitro conditions, HIV-1 infected human monocytes can productively release live viruses while differentiating into macrophages.\",\"In approximately 70% of individuals infected with HIV-1 subtype B, the virus switches coreceptor use from exclusively CCR5 use (R5 virus) to either inclusion of or exclusively CXCR4 use (X4 virus) during infection. This switch is associated with an accelerated loss of CD4(+) T-cells and a faster progression to AIDS. Despite intensive research, the mechanisms responsible for coreceptor switch remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated associations between viral evolutionary rate and selection pressure versus viral coreceptor use and rate of disease progression in eight patients with longitudinally sampled HIV-1 env V1-V3 sequences. By employing a Bayesian hierarchical phylogenetic model, we found that the HIV-1 evolutionary rate was more strongly associated with coreceptor switch than with rate of disease progression in terms of CD4(+)T-cell decline. Phylogenetic analyses showed that X4 variants evolved from R5 populations. In addition, coreceptor switch was associated with higher evolutionary rates on both the synonymous and non-synonymous substitution level, but not with dN/dS ratio rates. Our findings suggest that X4 viruses evolved from pre-existing R5 viral populations and that the evolution of coreceptor switch is governed by high replication rates rather than by selective pressure. Furthermore, the association of viral evolutionary rate was more strongly associated with coreceptor switch than disease progression. This adds to the understanding of the complex virus-host interplay that influences the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 coreceptor use. \",\"Genetic variability is a major feature of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and considered the key factor to frustrating efforts to halt the virus epidemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genetic variability of HIV-1 strains among children and adolescents born from 1992 to 2009 in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from 51 HIV-1-positive children and adolescents on ART followed between September 1992 and July 2009. After extraction, the genetic materials were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the viral near full length genomes (NFLGs) from 5 overlapped fragments. NFLGs and partial amplicons were directly sequenced and data were phylogenetically inferred. Of the 51 samples studied, the NFLGs and partial fragments of HIV-1 from 42 PBMCs and 25 plasma were successfully subtyped. Results based on proviral DNA revealed that 22 (52.4%) patients were infected with subtype B, 16 (38.1%) were infected with BF1 mosaic variants and 4 (9.5%) were infected with sub-subtype F1. All the BF1 recombinants were unique and distinct from any previously identified unique or circulating recombinant forms in South America. Evidence of dual infections was detected in 3 patients coinfected with the same or distinct HIV-1 subtypes. Ten of the 31 (32.2%) and 12 of the 21 (57.1%) subjects with recovered proviral and plasma, respectively, protease sequences were infected with major mutants resistant to protease inhibitors. The V3 sequences of 14 patients with available sequences from PBMC/or plasma were predicted to be R5-tropic virus except for two patients who harbored an X4 strain. The high proportion of HIV-1 BF1 recombinant, coinfection rate and vertical transmission in Brazil merits urgent attention and effective measures to reduce the transmission of HIV among spouses and sex partners.\",\"Human Immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) entry into target cells involves binding of the viral envelope (Env) to CD4 and a coreceptor, mainly CCR5 or CXCR4. The only currently licensed HIV entry inhibitor, maraviroc, targets CCR5, and the presence of CXCX4-using strains must be excluded prior to treatment. Co-receptor usage can be assessed by phenotypic assays or through genotypic prediction. Here we compared the performance of a phenotypic Env-Recombinant Viral Assay (RVA) to the two most widely used genotypic prediction algorithms, Geno2Pheno[coreceptor] and webPSSM. Co-receptor tropism of samples from 73 subtype B and 219 non-B infections was measured phenotypically using a luciferase-tagged, NL4-3-based, RVA targeting Env. In parallel, tropism was inferred genotypically from the corresponding V3-loop sequences using Geno2Pheno[coreceptor] (5-20% FPR) and webPSSM-R5X4. For discordant samples, phenotypic outcome was retested using co-receptor antagonists or the validated Trofile\\u00ae Enhanced-Sensitivity-Tropism-Assay. The lower detection limit of the RVA was 2.5% and 5% for X4 and R5 minority variants respectively. A phenotype/genotype result was obtained for 210 samples. Overall, concordance of phenotypic results with Geno2Pheno[coreceptor] was 85.2% and concordance with webPSSM was 79.5%. For subtype B, concordance with Geno2pheno[coreceptor] was 94.4% and concordance with webPSSM was 79.6%. High concordance of genotypic tools with phenotypic outcome was seen for subtype C (90% for both tools). Main discordances involved CRF01_AE and CRF02_AG for both algorithms (CRF01_AE: 35.9% discordances with Geno2Pheno[coreceptor] and 28.2% with webPSSM; CRF02_AG: 20.7% for both algorithms). Genotypic prediction overestimated CXCR4-usage for both CRFs. For webPSSM, 40% discordance was observed for subtype A. Phenotypic assays remain the most accurate for most non-B subtypes and new subtype-specific rules should be developed for non-B subtypes, as research studies more and more draw conclusions from genotypically-inferred tropism, and to avoid unnecessarily precluding patients with limited treatment options from receiving maraviroc or other entry inhibitors.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) fitness has been associated with virus entry, a process mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (Env). We previously described Env genetic diversification in a Zambian, subtype C infected, slow-progressor child (1157i) in parallel with an evolving neutralizing antibody response. Because of the role the Variable-3 loop (V3) plays in transmission, cell tropism, neutralization sensitivity, and fitness, longitudinally isolated 1157i C2-V4 alleles were cloned into HIV-1NL4-3-eGFP and -DsRed2 infectious molecular clones. The fluorescent reporters allowed for dual-infection competitions between all patient-derived C2-V4 chimeras to quantify the effect of V3 diversification and selection on fitness. 'Winners' and 'losers' were readily discriminated among the C2-V4 alleles. Exceptional sensitivity for detection of subtle fitness differences was revealed through analysis of two alleles differing in a single synonymous amino acid. However, when the outcomes of N\\u200a=\\u200a33 competitions were averaged for each chimera, the aggregate analysis showed that despite increasing diversification and divergence with time, natural selection of C2-V4 sequences in this individual did not appear to be producing a 'survival of the fittest' evolutionary pattern. Rather, we detected a relatively flat fitness landscape consistent with mutational robustness. Fitness outcomes were then correlated with individual components of the entry process. Env incorporation into particles correlated best with fitness, suggesting a role for Env avidity, as opposed to receptor/coreceptor affinity, in defining fitness. Nevertheless, biochemical analyses did not identify any step in HIV-1 entry as a dominant determinant of fitness. Our results lead us to conclude that multiple aspects of entry contribute to maintaining adequate HIV-1 fitness, and there is no surrogate analysis for determining fitness. The capacity for subtle polymorphisms in Env to nevertheless significantly impact viral fitness suggests fitness is best defined by head-to-head competition.\",\"CD4(+) T-cell loss is the hallmark of HIV-1 infection. CD4 counts fall more rapidly in advanced disease when CCR5-tropic viral strains tend to be replaced by X4-tropic viruses. We hypothesized: (i) that the early dominance of CCR5-tropic viruses results from faster turnover rates of CCR5(+) cells, and (ii) that X4-tropic strains exert greater pathogenicity by preferentially increasing turnover rates within the CXCR4(+) compartment. To test these hypotheses we measured in vivo turnover rates of CD4(+) T-cell subpopulations sorted by chemokine receptor expression, using in vivo deuterium-glucose labeling. Deuterium enrichment was modeled to derive in vivo proliferation (p) and disappearance (d*) rates which were related to viral tropism data. 13 healthy controls and 13 treatment-naive HIV-1-infected subjects (CD4 143-569 cells/ul) participated. CCR5-expression defined a CD4(+) subpopulation of predominantly CD45R0(+) memory cells with accelerated in vivo proliferation (p = 2.50 vs 1.60%/d, CCR5(+) vs CCR5(-); healthy controls; P<0.01). Conversely, CXCR4 expression defined CD4(+) T-cells (predominantly CD45RA(+) naive cells) with low turnover rates. The dominant effect of HIV infection was accelerated turnover of CCR5(+)CD45R0(+)CD4(+) memory T-cells (p = 5.16 vs 2.50%/d, HIV vs controls; P<0.05), na\\u00efve cells being relatively unaffected. Similar patterns were observed whether the dominant circulating HIV-1 strain was R5-tropic (n = 9) or X4-tropic (n = 4). Although numbers were small, X4-tropic viruses did not appear to specifically drive turnover of CXCR4-expressing cells (p = 0.54 vs 0.72 vs 0.44%/d in control, R5-tropic, and X4-tropic groups respectively). Our data are most consistent with models in which CD4(+) T-cell loss is primarily driven by non-specific immune activation.\",\"During the HIV-1 replication cycle, several molecules including chemokine receptors and cholesterol are crucial, and are therefore potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Indeed statins, compounds that inhibit cellular synthesis of cholesterol and have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties were shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection by R5 tropic strains but not by X4 strains in vitro, mainly by altering the chemokine receptor/ligands axes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize in vivo, the capacity of statins to modulate in HIV seronegative and chronically HIV-1-infected adults the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4, of their ligands and the tropism of circulating HIV-1 strains. Samples from asymptomatic HIV-1-infected adults enrolled in a clinical trial aimed at evaluating the antiretroviral activity of lovastatin were used to evaluate in vivo the modulation by lovastatin of CCR5, CXCR4, their ligands, and the shift in plasma viral tropism over one year of intervention. In addition, ten HIV negative adults received a daily oral dose of 40\\u00a0mg of lovastatin or 20\\u00a0mg of atorvastatin; seven other HIV negative individuals who received no treatment were followed as controls. The frequency and phenotype of immune cells were determined by flow-cytometry; mRNA levels of chemokine receptors and their ligands were determined by real-time PCR. Viral tropism was determined by PCR and sequencing, applying the clonal and clinical model of analyses. Our study shows that long-term administration of lovastatin in HIV-infected individuals does not induce a shift in viral tropism, or induce a significant modulation of CCR5 and CXCR4 on immune cells in HIV-infected patients. Similar results were found in HIV seronegative control subjects, treated with lovastatin or atorvastatin, but a significant increase in CCL3 and CCL4 transcription was observed in these individuals. These findings suggest that long-term administration of statins at therapeutic doses, does not significantly affect the expression of HIV-1 co-receptors or of their ligands. In addition it is important to point out that based on the results obtained, therapeutic administration of statins in HIV-infected patients with lipid disorders is safe in terms of selecting X4 strains.\",\"Platelets, anucleate cell fragments abundant in human blood, can capture HIV-1 and platelet counts have been associated with viral load and disease progression. However, the impact of platelets on HIV-1 infection of T cells is unclear. We found that platelets suppress HIV-1 spread in co-cultured T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Platelets containing granules inhibited HIV-1 spread in T cells more efficiently than degranulated platelets, indicating that the granule content might exert antiviral activity. Indeed, supernatants from activated and thus degranulated platelets suppressed HIV-1 infection. Infection was inhibited at the stage of host cell entry and inhibition was independent of the viral strain or coreceptor tropism. In contrast, blockade of HIV-2 and SIV entry was less efficient. The chemokine CXCL4, a major component of platelet granules, blocked HIV-1 entry and neutralization of CXCL4 in platelet supernatants largely abrogated their anti-HIV-1 activity. Release of CXCL4 by activated platelets inhibits HIV-1 infection of adjacent T cells at the stage of virus entry. The inhibitory activity of platelet-derived CXCL4 suggests a role of platelets in the defense against infection by HIV-1 and potentially other pathogens.\",\"BMS-663068 is the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of BMS-626529, a small-molecule attachment inhibitor that targets the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 preventing it from binding to CD4 T cells. In vitro investigations have demonstrated considerable variation in susceptibility of different HIV-1 isolates to BMS-626529. BMS-663068 monotherapy in HIV-1-infected subjects produced a mean maximum change from baseline of -1.64 log10 copies per milliliter, but the response was variable. In this analysis, baseline and day 8 samples were analyzed for susceptibility to BMS-626529 and the presence of known HIV-1 attachment inhibitor resistance mutations. In addition, predictors of virological response (maximal HIV-1 RNA decline \\u22651 log10 copies per milliliter) and resistance selection were investigated. The only factor associated with reduced virological response was low baseline susceptibility to BMS-626529. There was no apparent relationship between virological response and baseline treatment experience, coreceptor tropism, plasma HIV-1 RNA level, or CD4 T-cell count. Examination of all positions with known BMS-626529 resistance mutations based on in vitro selection studies showed that gp120 M426L was the primary substitution most clearly associated with nonresponse to BMS-663068. There was minimal change in susceptibility to BMS-626529 over the course of the study and no clear evidence of emergence of a known HIV-1 attachment inhibitor resistance mutation in the majority of subjects as measured by standard population-based phenotypic and genotypic approaches. Nonresponse to BMS-663068 was associated with low baseline susceptibility to BMS-626529 and the presence of M426L. In this short-term trial, there was minimal evidence of selection for BMS-626529 high-level resistance over 8 days of monotherapy with BMS-663068 by population-based approaches.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance to CCR5 antagonists, including maraviroc (MVC), results from alterations in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) enabling recognition of antagonist-bound CCR5. Here, we characterized tropism alterations for CD4+ T-cell subsets and macrophages by Envs from two subjects who developed MVC resistance in vivo, which displayed either relatively efficient or inefficient recognition of MVC-bound CCR5. We show that MVC-resistant Env with efficient recognition of drug-bound CCR5 displays a tropism shift for CD4+ T-cell subsets associated with increased infection of central memory T-cells and reduced infection of effector memory and transitional memory T-cells, and no change in macrophage infectivity. In contrast, MVC-resistant Env with inefficient recognition of drug-bound CCR5 displays no change in tropism for CD4+ T-cell subsets, but exhibits a significant reduction in macrophage infectivity. The pattern of HIV-1 tropism alterations for susceptible cells may therefore be variable in subjects with MVC resistance.\",\"Maraviroc currently represents an important antiretroviral drug for multi-experienced and viremic HIV patients. This study focused on two main points: (1) determining the prevalence of R5 and X4 HIV strains in antiretroviral-experienced patients using two main tests currently in use to determine viral tropism, and (2) the follow-up to 3 years of a limited number of patients who started a new antiretroviral protocol including maraviroc. A group of 56 HIV patients, previously multi-treated, were first analyzed by genotyping assay and Trofile\\u2122 to establish their eligibility for maraviroc treatment. In addition, 25 subjects selected to follow a new therapeutic protocol including a CCR5 antagonist were monitored by HIV RNA viral load and CD4+ cell count. The determination of viral tropism showed a large percentage of patients with an R5 profile (72% by genotyping assay and 74% by Trofile). The follow-up of most (21 out 25) patients who started the new antiretroviral protocol showed an undetectable viral load throughout the observation period, accompanied by a major improvement in CD4 cell count (cells/mm(3)) (baseline: median CD4 cell count 365, interquartile range (IQR) 204-511; 12 months: median value 501, IQR 349-677, p=0.042; 24 months: median value 503, IQR 386-678, p=0.026; 36 months: median value 601, IQR 517-717, p=0.001). Among the four non-responder subjects, two showed a lack of drug compliance and two switched from R5 to X4. Although our patient cohort was small, the results showed a high prevalence of R5 viral strains in multi-experienced patients. As well as showing the advantages of genotyping, which can be performed in plasma samples with low viral load replication, the follow-up of HIV patients selected for an alternative drug protocol, including a CCR5 antagonist, showed a persistent undetectable viral replication and a good recovery of CD4 cell count in most treated HIV patients.\",\"Defining the virus-host interactions responsible for HIV-1 transmission, including the phenotypic requirements of viruses capable of establishing de novo infections, could be important for AIDS vaccine development. Previous analyses have failed to identify phenotypic properties other than chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4+ T-cell tropism that are preferentially associated with viral transmission. However, most of these studies were limited to examining envelope (Env) function in the context of pseudoviruses. Here, we generated infectious molecular clones of transmitted founder (TF; n = 27) and chronic control (CC; n = 14) viruses of subtypes B (n = 18) and C (n = 23) and compared their phenotypic properties in assays specifically designed to probe the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found that TF virions were 1.7-fold more infectious (P = 0.049) and contained 1.9-fold more Env per particle (P = 0.048) compared with CC viruses. TF viruses were also captured by monocyte-derived dendritic cells 1.7-fold more efficiently (P = 0.035) and more readily transferred to CD4+ T cells (P = 0.025). In primary CD4+ T cells, TF and CC viruses replicated with comparable kinetics; however, when propagated in the presence of IFN-\\u03b1, TF viruses replicated to higher titers than CC viruses. This difference was significant for subtype B (P = 0.000013) but not subtype C (P = 0.53) viruses, possibly reflecting demographic differences of the respective patient cohorts. Together, these data indicate that TF viruses are enriched for higher Env content, enhanced cell-free infectivity, improved dendritic cell interaction, and relative IFN-\\u03b1 resistance. These viral properties, which likely act in concert, should be considered in the development and testing of AIDS vaccines.\",\"CXCR4-tropic (X4) variants are associated with faster disease progression than CCR5-tropic variants in HIV infection. We previously reported inhibition of CCR5 expression on U937 cells could protect the cells from HIV-1 infection. Here, we established recombinant adenoviruses containing anti-sense CXCR4 cDNA, to investigate its role in the protection of HIV entering into target cells. A fragment of 636 bp cDNA from CXCR4 mRNA was recombined into adenoviral vector and the recombinant adenovirus was obtained from AD-293 cells. The rates of CXCR4 expression on the MT4 cells infected with recombinant adenovirus were measured by FACS. The MT4 cells infected by recombinant adenovirus were challenged by T-tropic HIV-1 strains and then P24 antigen was assayed. The rate of expression of CXCR4 on MT4 cell infected with recombinant adenovirus was decreased from 42% to 1.12% at 24 h, and to 1.03%, 1.39%, and 1.23% at 48 h, 72 h and 10 days respectively. Compared with Ad-control cells, recombinant adenovirus infected MT4 cells produced much less P24 antigen after being challenged with HIV-1. Furthermore, the recombinant adenovirus had no effects on chemotactic activity and proliferation of the MT4 cells. In conclusion, recombinant adenoviruses containing anti-sense can inhibit CXCR4 expression and resist HIV-1 infection on MT4 cell lines.\",\"CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of \\u22651,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs.\",\"Analysis of proviral DNA in HIV infection may have useful applications if techniques that are sufficiently sensitive to detect minor variants, such as single genome sequencing (SGS), are used. This technology, which is performed in DNA from whole blood, improves determination of co-receptor tropism and the detection of both circulating and archived resistance mutations (RM) that are undetectable in plasma. Many of these RM have clinical relevance and their identification could be useful in specific situations, such as the start of antiretroviral therapy to exclude the transmission of resistant strains, as information to be weighed in simplification strategies in patients with undetectable viral loads, and in antiretroviral-experienced patients with limited availability of clinical reports. Clonal analysis using SGS has yielded useful information on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of HIV-1 infection but, in its current design, is inappropriate for the clinical laboratory. The new generation of sequencing technology, which allows the simultaneous analysis of a large number of sequences, has begun to be applied in the analysis of the diversity of plasma HIV-1. The use of these highly sensitive, automated techniques in the analysis of HIV-1 cellular reservoirs will potentially allow all variants recorded during the history of the disease to become available. This information would be highly useful for the clinical management of HIV-1 infection at the individual and population level.\",\"This 8-year longitudinal study was aimed to analyze the HIV-1 gp120-C2V3C3 sequence dynamics, their phylogenetic relationships and tropism evolution in patients under HAART. Such viral analysis comprised two compartments: plasma and PBMC. Fifty gp120-C2V3C3 genomic sequences were characterized from 16 patients: 41 from plasma when viremia was measurable and 9 from PBMCs if plasma viral load was undetectable. The vast majority of HIV isolates (43 out of 50) were ascribed to BF subtype, irrespective of the compartment (plasma or mononuclear-cells) analyzed. A statistically well-supported clustering phenomenon was observed for each patient sampling data. Each cluster comprised viral sequences from both compartments analyzed. In the vast majority of cases, the viral sequences obtained along active production periods were intermingled with those identified from proviral sequences. A substantial stability of co-receptor tropism for the HIV BF subtype was observed over an 8-year followup.\",\"Gene therapy using a Tat-dependent expression system of MazF, an ACA nucleotide sequence-specific endoribonuclease derived from Escherichia coli, in a retroviral vector appears to be an alternative approach to the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. MazF can cleave HIV-1 RNA, since it has more than 240 ACA sequences. Significant inhibition of viral replication, irrespective of HIV-1 strains, was observed in CD4(+) T cells that had been transduced with the MazF-expressing retroviral vector (MazF-T cells). The growth and viability of MazF-T cells were not affected by HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, the infectivity of HIV-1 produced from MazF-T cells was found to be lower than that from control CD4(+) T cells. A long-term culture experiment with HIV-1-infected cells revealed that viral replication was always lower in MazF-T cells than in CD4(+) T cells transduced with or without a control vector for more than 200 days. MazF was expressed and mainly localized in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Unlike in CD4(+) T cells, the expression level of Tat gradually decreased rather than increased in MazF-T cells after HIV-1 infection. As a consequence, the expression level of MazF appeared to be well regulated and sustained during HIV-1 infection in MazF-T cells. Furthermore, the levels of cellular mRNA were not affected by HIV-1 infection. Thus, the Tat-dependent MazF expression system has great potential for inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo without apparent toxicity and may be able to avoid the emergence of resistant strains.\",\"Mucosally transmissible and pathogenic CCR5 (R5)-tropic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) molecular clones are useful reagents to identity neutralization escape in HIV-1 vaccine experiments and to study the envelope evolutionary process and mechanistic basis for coreceptor switch during the course of natural infection. We observed progression to AIDS in rhesus macaques infected intrarectally with molecular clones of the pathogenic R5 SHIVSF162P3N isolate. Expansion to CXCR4 usage was documented in one diseased macaque that mounted a neutralizing antibody response and in another that failed to do so, with the latter displaying a rapid progressor phenotype. V3 loop envelop glycoprotein gp120 sequence changes that are predictive of a CXCR4 (X4)-using phenotype in HIV-1 subtype B primary isolates, specifically basic amino acid substations at positions 11 (S11R), 24 (G24R) and 25 (D25K) of the loop were detected in the two infected macaques. Functional assays showed that envelopes with V3 S11R or D25K mutation were dual-tropic, infecting CD4+ target cells that expressed either the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor. And, consistent with findings of coreceptor switching in macaques infected with the pathogenic isolate, CXCR4-using variant was first detected in the lymph node of the chronically infected rhesus monkey several weeks prior to its presence in peripheral blood. Moreover, X4 emergence in this macaque coincided with persistent peripheral CD4+ T cell loss and a decline in neutralizing antibody titer that are suggestive of immune deterioration, with macrophages as the major virus-producing cells at the end-stage of disease. The data showed that molecular clones derived from the R5 SHIVSF162P3N isolate are mucosally transmissible and induced disease in a manner similar to that observed in HIV-1 infected individuals, providing a relevant and useful animal infection model for in-depth analyses of host selection pressures and the env evolutionary changes that influence disease outcome, coreceptor switching and vaccine escape.\",\"The development of an animal model of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/AIDS that is suitable for preclinical testing of antiretroviral therapy, vaccines, curative strategies, and studies of pathogenesis has been hampered by the human-specific tropism of HIV-1. Although simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or HIV-1/SIV chimeric viruses (SHIVs)-rhesus macaque models are excellent surrogates for AIDS research, the genetic differences between SIV or SHIV and HIV-1 limit their utility as model systems. The identification of innate retro viral restriction factors has increased our understanding about blockades to HIV-1 replication in macaques and provided a guide for the construction of macaque-tropic HIV-1 clones. However, while these viruses replicate in macaque cells in vitro, they are easily controlled and have not caused AIDS in host animals, indicating that we may not fully understand the restrictive barriers of innate immunity. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding HIV-1 restriction factors, particularly as they apply to cross-species transmission of primate lentiviruses and the development of a macaque model of HIV-1/AIDS. \",\"HIV-1 subtype B replication in the CNS can occur in CD4+ T cells or macrophages/microglia in adults. However, little is known about CNS infection in children or the ability of subtype C HIV-1 to evolve macrophage-tropic variants. In this study, we examined HIV-1 variants in ART-na\\u00efve children aged three years or younger to determine viral genotypes and phenotypes associated with HIV-1 subtype C pediatric CNS infection. We examined HIV-1 subtype C populations in blood and CSF of 43 Malawian children with neurodevelopmental delay or acute neurological symptoms. Using single genome amplification (SGA) and phylogenetic analysis of the full-length env gene, we defined four states: equilibrated virus in blood and CSF (n\\u200a=\\u200a20, 47%), intermediate compartmentalization (n\\u200a=\\u200a11, 25%), and two distinct types of compartmentalized CSF virus (n\\u200a=\\u200a12, 28%). Older age and a higher CSF/blood viral load ratio were associated with compartmentalization, consistent with independent replication in the CNS. Cell tropism was assessed using pseudotyped reporter viruses to enter a cell line on which CD4 and CCR5 receptor expression can be differentially induced. In a subset of compartmentalized cases (n\\u200a=\\u200a2, 17%), the CNS virus was able to infect cells with low CD4 surface expression, a hallmark of macrophage-tropic viruses, and intermediate compartmentalization early was associated with an intermediate CD4 entry phenotype. Transmission of multiple variants was observed for 5 children; in several cases, one variant was sequestered within the CNS, consistent with early stochastic colonization of the CNS by virus. Thus we hypothesize two pathways to compartmentalization: early stochastic sequestration in the CNS of one of multiple variants transmitted from mother to child, and emergence of compartmentalized variants later in infection, on average at age 13.5 months, and becoming fully apparent in the CSF by age 18 months. Overall, compartmentalized viral replication in the CNS occurred in half of children by year three.\",\"After infection and integration steps, HIV-1 transcriptions increase sharply and singly-spliced mRNAs are produced. These encode Env (gp120 and gp41) and auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpr and VpU. The same localization within the unique structure of the mRNAs suggests that the VpU sequence prior to the Env could affect the Env polyprotein expression.The HIV-1 infection process begins when the gp120 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein complex interacts with its receptor(s) on the target cell. The V3 domain of gp120 is the major determinant of cellular co-receptor binding. According to phenotypic information of HIV-1 isolates, sequences from the VpU to V3 regions (119 in R5- and 120 X4-tropic viruses; one per patient) were analysed. The binomial correlation phi coefficient was used to assess covariation among VpU and gp120(V3) signatures. Subsequently, average linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed. Beyond the classical V3 signatures (R5-viruses: S11, E25D; X4-viruses: S11KR, E25KRQ), other specific V3 and novel VpU signatures were found to be statistically associated with co-receptor usage. Several statistically significant associations between V3 and VpU mutations were also observed. The dendrogram showed two distinct large clusters: one associated with R5-tropic sequences (bootstrap=0.94), involving: (a) H13NP(V3), E25D(V3), S11(V3), T22A(V3) and Q61H(VpU), (b) E25A(V3) and L12F(VpU), (c) D44E(VpU), R18Q(V3) and D80N(VpU); and another associated with X4-tropic sequences (bootstrap=0.97), involving: (i) E25I(V3) and V10A(VpU), (ii) 0-1insV(VpU), H13R(V3), I46L(VpU), I30M(V3) and 60-62del(VpU), (iii) S11KR(V3) and E25KRQ(V3). Some of these pairs of mutations were encoded always by one specific codon. These data indicate the possible VpU mutational patterns contributing to regulation of HIV-1 tropism.\",\"We previously reported that adoption of an \\\"open\\\" envelope glycoprotein (Env) to expose the CD4 binding site for efficient receptor binding and infection of cell targets such as macrophages that express low levels of the receptor represents an early event in the process of coreceptor switch in two rapidly progressing (RP) R5 SHIV(SF162P3N)-infected rhesus macaques, releasing or reducing Env structural constraints that have been suggested to limit the pathways available for a change in coreceptor preference. Here we extended these studies to two additional RP monkeys with coreceptor switch and three without to confirm and identify additional factors that facilitated the process of phenotypic conversion. We found that regardless of coreceptor switching, R5 viruses in SHIV(SF162P3N)-infected RP macaques evolved over time to infect macrophages more efficiently; this was accompanied by increased sCD4 sensitivity, with structural changes in the CD4 binding site, the V3 loop and/or the fusion domain of their Envs that are suggestive of better CD4 contact, CCR5 usage and/or virus fusion. However, sCD4-sensitive variants with improved CD4 binding were observed only in RPs with coreceptor switch. Furthermore, cumulative viral load was higher in RPs with than in those without phenotypic switch, with the latter maintaining a longer period of seroconversion. Our data suggest that the increased virus replication in the RPs with R5-to-X4 conversion increased the rate of virus evolution and reduction in the availability of target cells with optimal CD4 expression heightened the competition for binding to the receptor. In the absence of immunological restrictions, variants that adopt an \\\"open\\\" Env to expose the CD4 binding site for better CD4 use are selected, allowing structural changes that confer CXCR4-use to be manifested. Viral load, change in target cell population during the course of infection and host immune response therefore are interdependent variables that influence R5 virus evolution and coreceptor switch in SHIV(SF162P3N)-infected rhesus macaques. Because an \\\"open\\\" Env conformation also renders the virus more susceptible to antibody neutralization, our findings help to explain the infrequent and late appearance of X4 virus in HIV-1 infection when the immune system deteriorates.\",\"The interest in integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) stems from their potential advantage of large cloning capacity and broad cell tropism while avoiding the possibility of insertional mutagenesis. Here, we directly compared the transducing potential of IDLVs based on the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) to the more commonly described HIV-1 IDLVs. IDLVs were constructed by introducing equivalent single/triple mutations into the integrase catalytic triad. We show that both the single and the triple mutant HIV-1 IDLVs transduce the PC12 cells, but not the C2C12 cells, with similar efficiency to their parental HIV-1 vector. In contrast, the single and triple EIAV IDLVs did not efficiently transduce either differentiated cell line. Moreover, this HIV-1 IDLV-mediated expression was independent of any residual integration activity because reporter expression was lost when cell cycling was restored. Four weeks following stereotactic administration into adult rat brains, only the single HIV-1 IDLV mutant displayed a comparable transduction profile to the parental HIV-1 vector. In contrast, neither EIAV IDLV mutants showed significant reporter gene expression. This work indicates that the transducing potential of IDLVs appears to depend not only on the choice of integrase mutation and type of target cell, but also on the nature of the lentiviral vector.Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids (2012) 1, e60; doi:10.1038/mtna.2012.53; published online 11 December 2012.\",\"Hepatic stellate cells, the major producers of extracellular matrix in the liver, and hepatocytes bear CXCR4 and CCR5, the two main co-receptors for entry of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In vitro studies suggest that HIV-envelope proteins can modulate the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and fibrogenesis. We investigated the influence of HIV tropism on liver fibrosis and the concentration of HCV RNA in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. We used a phenotypic assay to assess HIV tropism in 172 HCV-HIV co-infected patients: one group (75 patients) had mild fibrosis (score \\u2264F2) and the other (97 patients) had severe fibrosis (score >F2). We also assessed the relationship between HIV tropism and HCV RNA concentration in all these patients. We also followed 34 of these patients for 3 years to determine the evolution of HIV tropism and liver fibrosis, estimated by liver stiffness. Initially, most patients (91.8%) received a potent antiretroviral therapy. CXCR4-using viruses were found in 29% of patients. The only factor associated with a CXCR4-using virus infection in multivariate analysis was the nadir of CD4 cells: <200/mm(3) (OR: 3.94, 95%CI: 1.39-11.14). The median HCV RNA concentrations in patients infected with R5 viruses, those with dual-mixed viruses and those with X4 viruses, were all similar. The prevalence of CXCR4-using viruses in patients with mild fibrosis (\\u2264F2) (31%) and those with severe fibrosis (F3-F4) (28%, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.6) was similar. Longitudinal analyses showed that the presence of CXCR4-using viruses did not increase the likelihood of fibrosis progression, evaluated by measuring liver stiffness. The presence of CXCR4-using viruses in patients receiving a potent antiretroviral therapy does not influence HCV RNA concentration or liver fibrosis.\",\"The role of disulfide bond remodeling in HIV-1 infection is well described, but the process still remains incompletely characterized. At present, the data have been predominantly obtained using established cell lines and/or CXCR4-tropic laboratory-adapted virus strains. There is also ambiguity about which disulfide isomerases/reductases play a major role in HIV-1 entry, as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and/or thioredoxin (Trx) have emerged as the two enzymes most often implicated in this process. We have extended our previous findings and those of others by focusing on CCR5-using HIV-1 strains and their natural targets--primary human macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes. We found that the nonspecific thiol/disulfide exchange inhibitor, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), significantly reduced HIV-1 entry and infection in cell lines, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and also phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Subsequent studies were performed using specific anti-PDI or Trx monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in HIV-1 envelope pseudotyped and wild type (wt) virus infection systems. Although human donor-to-donor variability was observed as expected, Trx appeared to play a greater role than PDI in HIV-1 infection of MDM. In contrast, PDI, but not Trx, was predominantly involved in HIV-1 entry and infection of the CD4+/CCR5+ T cell line, PM-1, and PHA-stimulated primary human T lymphocytes. Intriguingly, both PDI and Trx were present on the surface of MDM, PM-1 and PHA-stimulated CD4+ T cells. However, considerably lower levels of Trx were detected on freshly isolated CD4+ lymphocytes, compared to PHA-stimulated cells. Our findings clearly demonstrate the role of thiol/disulfide exchange in HIV-1 entry in primary T lymphocytes and MDM. They also establish a cell-type specificity regarding the involvement of particular disulfide isomerases/reductases in this process and may provide an explanation for differences among previously published studies. More importantly, from an in vivo perspective, the preferential utilization of PDI may be relevant to the HIV-1 entry and establishment of virus reservoirs in resting CD4+ cells, while the elevated levels of Trx reported in the chronic stages of HIV-1 infection may facilitate the virus entry in macrophages and help to sustain high viremia during the decline of T lymphocytes.\",\"Apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells is a key element of HIV pathogenesis and believed to be the driving force behind the selective depletion of CD4+ T cells leading to immunodeficiency. While several viral proteins have been implicated in this process the complex interaction between Env glycoprotein expressed on the surface of infected cells and the receptor and co-receptor expressing bystander cells has been proposed as a major mechanism. HIV-1 utilizes CD4 as the primary receptor for entry into cells; however, it is the viral co-receptor usage that greatly influences CD4 decline and progression to AIDS. This phenomenon is relatively simple for X4 viruses, which arise later during the course of the disease, are considered to be highly fusogenic, and cause a rapid CD4+ T cell decline. However, in contrast, R5 viruses in general have a greater transmissibility, are encountered early during the disease and have a lesser pathogenic potential than the former. The above generalization gets complicated in numerous situations where R5 viruses persist throughout the disease and are capable of causing a rigorous CD4+ T cell decline. This review will discuss the multiple factors that are reported to influence HIV induced bystander apoptosis and pathogenesis including Env glycoprotein phenotype, virus tropism, disease stage,  co-receptor expression on CD4+ T cells, immune activation and therapies targeting the viral envelope.\",\"This study was performed to evaluate a once-daily dual-therapy regimen, maraviroc (MVC) + atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r), in treatment-naive patients. A phase 2b, randomized, open-label pilot study. In Study A4001078 (NCT00827112), treatment-naive patients with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (HIV-1 RNA \\u22651000 copies/mL; CD4 cell count \\u2265100 cells/mm) were randomized to receive either MVC 150 mg once daily (n = 60) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) 300/200 mg once daily (n = 61) + ATV/r 300/100 mg once daily. Primary endpoint was proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter at week 48. At week 48, 44 (74.6%) and 51 (83.6%) patients in the MVC and TDF/FTC treatment groups, respectively, had plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter. Median change from baseline in CD4 cell count at week 48 was +173 and +187 cells per cubic millimeter with MVC and TDF/FTC, respectively. Seven patients discontinued from each arm; there were no deaths. The incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was similar in each group; however, there were more grade 3/4 AEs in the MVC group (18 vs 11), mostly due to hyperbilirubinemia. Three patients in each arm were evaluable for virological analysis at discontinuation or failure (HIV-1 RNA >500 copies/mL); no genotypic resistance, change in tropism, or loss of susceptibility relevant to treatment was observed. The virological activity and immunological benefit of once-daily MVC + ATV/r were confirmed. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia and associated signs were the most commonly reported AEs in both study treatment groups and were not associated with significant transaminase increases. No drug resistance occurred.\",\"The penile urethra is routinely targeted by sexually transmitted bacterial and viral pathogens, and also represents a probable site for HIV type-1 (HIV-1) entry. Yet, the mechanisms of urethral HIV-1 transmission are unknown. To describe the initial steps of penile HIV-1 entry, we obtained whole penile tissues from individuals undergoing elective gender reassignment and developed ex vivo polarized explants of different penile epithelia, as well as in vitro immunocompetent reconstructed urethra. In penile explants, 1\\u2009h exposure to cell-associated HIV-1 results in higher HIV-1 entry into the urethra, whereas the fossa navicularis and glans are relatively resistant to HIV-1. CCR5+/CD4+ urethral macrophages are the initial cells infected by HIV-1, which exit the epithelial compartment following inoculation with cell-associated HIV-1 that induces decreased CCL2/MCP-1 production. Urethral T cells are mostly CD8+ or naive CD4+, and not infected by HIV-1 on its early entry. In urethral reconstructions, efficient translocation of cell-associated HIV-1 depends on viral tropism (R5>X4) and can be decreased by gp41-specific IgAs. Cell-free HIV-1 is inefficient at urethral penetration. Our results identify the male urethra as a novel entry site for HIV-1 that targets resident urethral macrophages. These results might explain the incomplete prophylactic efficacy of male circumcision in reducing HIV-1 transmission.\",\"We have produced high-titre HIV-1 green fluorescent protein-expressing lentiviral (LV) vectors pseudotyped with strain 3908 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus glycoprotein (VEEV-G) and used them to study transduction of: (1) rat embryonic motor neuron (MN) and striatal neuron primary cultures, (2) differentiated MN cell line NSC-34 and (3) adult rat striatum. In primary neuronal cultures, transduction with VEEV-G-pseudotyped LV was more efficient and more neuronal than with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped LV. In NSC-34 cells clear retrograde transport of VEEV-G vector particles was observed. In the striatum at the injection site, transduction with the VEEV-G vectors driven by cytomegalovirus or phosphoglycerate kinase promoters exhibited a distinct neuronal tropism with no microglial and only a minor astroglial component, superior to that obtained with VSV-G-pseudotyped LV, irrespective of the promoter used. Neuronal transduction efficiency increased over time. Distal to the injection site transduction of mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, thalamic neurons and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta was detected. This, together with observations of retrograde axonal trafficking in vitro indicates that these vectors also possess low level of retrograde neuronal transduction capability in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate both strong neurotropism as well as sustainability of expression and minimal host immune response in vivo, making the VEEV-G-pseudotyped LV vectors potentially useful for gene therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. \",\"The aim of the study was to qualitatively and semiquantitatively characterize the expression of the principal HIV co-receptors chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) on susceptible CD4 T-helper cell, monocyte/macrophage and Langerhans dendritic cell populations within the cervical epithelia of asymptomatic women attending a genitourinary medicine clinic. Of 77 asymptomatic women recruited, 35 were excluded: 21 because they were found to have bacterial vaginosis, eight because they were found to have candida and six for other reasons. Cervical cytobrush samples from 11 women with Chlamydia trachomatis infection and 31 women without any detectable genital infection were stained with fluorescently labelled antibodies specific for cell surface CCR5, CXCR4, CD4, CD3, CD1a and CD19 expression, then analysed by flow cytometry. CD4/CD3 T-helper cells (84%), CD1a Langerhans dendritic cells (75%) and CD4/CD14 monocytes/macrophages (59%) were detected in the samples. CCR5 and CXCR4 HIV co-receptor expression was observed on 46-86% of the above subsets. CD1a cells exhibited significantly higher CCR5 and CXCR4 positivity and median fluorescence than CD4 cells and higher CXCR4 positivity and median fluorescence than CD14 cells (P < 0.05 or less). Increased detection of CCR5 over CXCR4 was seen in CD14 cells (P < 0.05). No significant differences in CCR5 or CXCR4 expression were found in samples from asymptomatic women with or without chlamydial infection. Co-receptor expression confirms the potential for CD1a Langerhans cells, monocytes/macrophages and T-helper cells in the cervix as primary targets for HIV infection. Previously observed selective transmission of CCR5-tropic isolates cannot be accounted for by a lack of CXCR4-expressing CD4 cervical immune cells. We were unable to identify any specific impact of chlamydial infection on co-receptor expression in this study.\",\"The aims of the study were to assess in patients with advanced HIV disease receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) intensification with enfuvirtide (i) resistance at virological failure (VF), (ii) impact of baseline tropism on immunovirological response, and (iii) HIV-1 DNA tropism evolution during ART. The ANRS 130 APOLLO randomized trial evaluated in naive patients the immunovirological impact of standard ART without (control arm) or with enfuvirtide. Tropism was determined on RNA and DNA by V3-loop sequencing interpreted using the Geno2Pheno algorithm. At baseline the median CD4 cell count was 30 cells/mm(3). Among the 170 patients assessable in this virological substudy, HIV-1 RNA tropism was as follows: 60% of viruses were R5 and 40% were R5X4/X4. HIV-1 DNA tropism was as follows: 54% were R5 and 46% were R5X4/X4. At week 24, 39% and 49% of patients experienced VF in the enfuvirtide and control arms, respectively. In the enfuvirtide arm, only resistance-associated mutations to enfuvirtide were detected. In the control arm, two patients displayed drug-resistant viruses at the time of VF. No impact of baseline tropism was observed on immunovirological response, regardless of the study arm. Among the 25 patients experiencing DNA tropism switch between baseline and week 24, 16 (64%) switched from R5 to R5X4/X4. These latter were mostly successfully suppressed patients receiving enfuvirtide and exhibiting poorer immunological response. Baseline RNA tropism had no impact on the immunovirological response. Drug resistance mutations were only detected for the fusion inhibitor. Finally, the mechanism of replenishment of the viral cellular reservoir with X4 viruses observed needs to be further analysed.\",\"Transmission of HIV-1 results in the establishment of a new infection, typically starting from a single virus particle. That virion replicates to generate viremia and persistent infection in all of the lymphoid tissue in the body. HIV-1 preferentially infects T cells with high levels of CD4 and those subsets of T cells that express CCR5, particularly memory T cells. Most of the replicating virus is in the lymphoid tissue, yet most of samples studied are from blood. For the most part the tissue and blood viruses represent a well-mixed population. With the onset of immunodeficiency, the virus evolves to infect new cell types. The tropism switch involves switching from using CCR5 to CXCR4 and corresponds to an expansion of infected cells to include na\\u00efve CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, the virus evolves the ability to enter cells with low levels of CD4 on the surface and this potentiates the ability to infect macrophages, although the scope of sites where infection of macrophages occurs and the link to pathogenesis is only partly known and is clear only for infection of the central nervous system. A model linking viral evolution to these two pathways has been proposed. Finally, other disease states related to immunodeficiency may be the result of viral infection of additional tissues, although the evidence for a direct role for the virus is less strong. Advancing immunodeficiency creates an environment in which viral evolution results in viral variants that can target new cell types to generate yet another class of opportunistic infections (i.e., HIV-1 with altered tropism).\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission results from infection with one or a small number of variants from the donor quasispecies. Transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses have recently been identified from acutely infected patients, but the way in which they interact with primary targets of HIV-1 infection is poorly understood. We have conducted a biological characterization of a panel of subtype B T/F acute and chronic envelope (Env)-expressing chimeric virus in primary human target cells and mucosal tissues. Both acute and chronic Envs preferentially replicated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and a CD4 T-cell line compared to monocyte-derived macrophages, or dendritic cells (DC). In a model of trans infection from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to T cells, chimeric virus from acute Envs achieved significantly lower titers compared to chronic Envs. Challenge of primary human mucosal tissues revealed significantly higher levels of replication in chronic Env-expressing virus in rectal tissue compared to cervical and penile tissues and enhanced replication in tonsillar tissue relative to acute Envs. In agreement with data from the DC to T-cell trans infection assay, chronic Env-chimeric virus pools were transmitted more efficiently by migratory cells from cervical and penile tissues to CD4(+) T cells than individual acute Env chimeras. These data indicate that virus with HIV-1 Envs of transmitted acute infections preferentially replicate in T cells rather than macrophages or dendritic cells and are less efficiently transmitted from antigen-presenting cells to CD4 T cells than chronic Envs. Such properties together with chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) use may confer an advantage for transmission.\",\"Vpr is exclusively expressed in primate lentiviruses and contributes to viral replication and disease progression in vivo. HIV-1 Vpr has two major activities in vitro: arrest of cell cycle in the G2 phase (G2 arrest), and enhancement of viral replication in macrophages. Previously, we reported a potent HIV-1 restriction in the human CD4+ CEM.NKR (NKR) T cells, where wild-type (WT) HIV-1 replication was inhibited by almost 1,000-fold. From the parental NKR cells, we isolated eight clones by limiting dilution. These clones showed three levels of resistance to the WT HIV-1 infection: non-permissive (NP), semi-permissive (SP), and permissive (P). Here, we compared the replication of WT, Vif-defective, Vpr-defective, and Vpu-defective viruses in these cells. Although both WT and Vpu-defective viruses could replicate in the permissive and semi-permissive clones, the replication of Vif-defective and Vpr-defective viruses was completely restricted. The expression of APOBEC3G (A3G) cytidine deaminase in NKR cells explains why Vif, but not Vpr, was required for HIV-1 replication. When the Vpr-defective virus life cycle was compared with the WT virus life cycle in the semi-permissive cells, it was found that the Vpr-defective virus could enter the cell and produce virions containing properly processed Gag and Env proteins, but these virions showed much less efficiency for reverse transcription during the next-round of infection. In addition, although viral replication was restricted in the non-permissive cells, treatment with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) could completely restore WT, but not Vpr-defective virus replication. Moreover, disruption of Vpr binding to its cofactor DCAF1 and/or induction of G2 arrest activity did not disrupt the Vpr activity in enhancing HIV-1 replication in NKR cells. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 replication in NKR cells is Vpr-dependent. Vpr promotes HIV-1 replication from the 2nd cycle likely by overcoming a block at early stage of viral replication; and this activity does not require DCAF1 and G2 arrest. Further studies of this mechanism should provide new understanding of Vpr function in the HIV-1 life cycle.\",\"The reversible phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) is a well-characterized mechanism of translational control in response to a wide variety of cellular stresses, including viral infection. Beside PKR, the eIF2alpha kinase GCN2 participates in the cellular response against viral infection by RNA viruses with central nervous system tropism. PKR has also been involved in the antiviral response against HIV-1, although this antiviral effect is very limited due to the distinct mechanisms evolved by the virus to counteract PKR action. Here we report that infection of human cells with HIV-1 conveys the proteolytic cleavage of GCN2 and that purified HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases produce direct proteolysis of GCN2 in vitro, abrogating the activation of GCN2 by HIV-1 RNA. Transfection of distinct cell lines with a plasmid encoding an HIV-1 cDNA clone competent for a single round of replication resulted in the activation of GCN2 and the subsequent eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Moreover, transfection of GCN2 knockout cells or cells with low levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha with the same HIV-1 cDNA clone resulted in a marked increase of HIV-1 protein synthesis. Also, the over-expression of GCN2 in cells led to a diminished viral protein synthesis. These findings suggest that viral RNA produced during HIV-1 infection activates GCN2 leading to inhibition of viral RNA translation, and that HIV-1 protease cleaves GCN2 to overcome its antiviral effect.\",\"The HIV-1 coreceptor usage may play a critical role in AIDS pathogenesis and the X4-using viruses are considered to be more pathogenic than the R5-tropic viruses. These observations may influence the therapeutic decisions by asking for an earlier antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for the patients infected by the X4-tropic viruses compared with those infected by the R5-tropic viruses. The natural evolution of CD4+ cell count for 109 non-treated patients infected by the R5- or X4-tropic HIV-1 viruses with CD4+ >350 and >500 cells/mm(3) at time of diagnosis was compared until the initiation of an ARV regimen. The coreceptor usage was determined from the V3 env region sequence by Geno2Pheno (false positive rate 10%). A mixed linear regression model to analyse the CD4+ data with tropism as fixed effect in the model was used. Overall, 93 (85.3%) and 16 (14.7%) were infected by R5- and X4-tropic viruses, respectively. The median age, baseline CD4+ cell count, and viral load were 34 years (IQR: 30-42), 523 cells/mm(3) (IQR: 420-604), and 4.5 log(10) \\u2009copies/ml (IQR: 3.9-5.0), respectively. There was no statistical difference in time to progression between the patients harboring R5- or X4-tropic viruses. The same results were observed for the sub-group of patients with CD4+ cell count >500 cells/mm(3). The virus tropism has no impact on the CD4+ cell count evolution in these HIV-1 patients diagnosed with CD4+ >350 or >500 cells/mm(3) suggesting that the tropism determination at time of diagnosis does not seem to be a useful tool to predict the clinical progression.\",\"SIV model indicates that upon traversing the cervicovaginal mucosa, SIV/SIV-infected cells migrate to regional lymph nodes where active replication occurs prior to systemic virus dissemination. The purpose of the study is to develop a model to study early HIV-1 transmission events that occur after crossing the cervical mucosa into regional lymph nodes. We developed an organ culture model combining intact cervical tissue explants and tonsil tissue cells as the surrogate draining lymphoid tissue. Viral replication was measured by HIV-1 p24 production, quantification of viral DNA and viral RNA expression in tonsil cells. In this combined organ culture model, transmission of cell-free and cell-associated R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 through the cervical mucosa to tonsilar cells was observed as determined by HIV-1 p24 in culture supernatant, and the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA, HIV-1 p24 gag protein in CD4(+) , CD11c(+) , CD68(+)  cells, and expression of HIV-1 mRNA expressing CD45RO(+) \\u00a0CD4 T cells in tonsil cells. Furthermore, co-receptor usage of HIV-1 in tonsil cells correlated with inoculating virus tropism. Our combined cervix-tonsil organ culture could serve as an experimental model to study the earliest stages of HIV-1 transmission through cervicovaginal mucosa to its proximal lymph nodes.\",\"Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) play a key role in the regulation of the immune system and are the target of numerous gene therapy applications. The genetic modification of MDDCs is possible with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-derived lentiviral vectors (LVs) but requires high viral doses to bypass their natural resistance to viral infection, and this in turn affects their physiological properties. To date, a single viral protein is able to counter this restrictive phenotype, Vpx, a protein derived from members of the HIV-2/simian immunodeficiency virus SM lineage that counters at least two restriction factors present in myeloid cells. By tagging Vpx with a short heterologous membrane-targeting domain, we have obtained HIV-1 LVs incorporating high levels of this protein (HIV-1-Src-Vpx). These vectors efficiently transduce differentiated MDDCs and monocytes either as previously purified populations or as populations within unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, these vectors can be efficiently pseudotyped with receptor-specific envelopes, further restricting their cellular tropism almost uniquely to MDDCs. Compared to conventional HIV-1 LVs, these novel vectors allow for an efficient genetic modification of MDDCs and, more importantly, do not cause their maturation or affect their survival, which are unwanted side effects of the transduction process. This study describes HIV-1-Src-Vpx LVs as a novel potent tool for the genetic modification of differentiated MDDCs and of circulating monocyte precursors with strong potential for a wide range of gene therapy applications.\",\"BR-derived HIV-1 strains have an exceptional ability to enter macrophages via mechanisms involving their gp120 Env that remain incompletely understood. Here, we used cell-based affinity-profiling methods and mathematical modeling to generate quantitative VERSA metrics that simultaneously measure Env-CD4 and Env-CCR5 interactions. These metrics were analyzed to distinguish the phenotypes of M-tropic and non-M-tropic CCR5-using HIV-1 variants derived from autopsy BRs and LNs, respectively. We show that highly M-tropic Env variants derived from brain can be defined by two distinct and simultaneously occurring phenotypes. First, BR-derived Envs demonstrated an enhanced ability to interact with CD4 compared with LN-derived Envs, permitting entry into cells expressing scant levels of CD4. Second, BR-derived Envs displayed an altered mechanism of engagement between CD4-bound gp120 and CCR5 occurring in tandem. With the use of epitope mapping, mutagenesis, and structural studies, we show that this altered mechanism is characterized by increased exposure of CD4-induced epitopes in gp120 and by a more critical interaction between BR-derived Envs and the CCR5 N-terminus, which was associated with the predicted presence of additional atomic contacts formed at the gp120-CCR5 N-terminus interface. Our results suggest that BR-derived HIV-1 variants with highly efficient macrophage entry adopt conformations in gp120 that simultaneously alter the way in which the Env interacts with CD4 and CCR5.\",\"HIV-1 R5 viruses vary extensively in their capacity to infect macrophages. R5 viruses that confer efficient infection of macrophages are able to exploit low levels of CD4 for infection and predominate in brain tissue, where macrophages are a major target for infection. HIV-1 R5 founder viruses that are transmitted were reported to be non-macrophage-tropic. Here, we investigated the sensitivities of macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic R5 envelopes to neutralizing antibodies. We observed striking differences in the sensitivities of Env(+) pseudovirions to soluble CD4 (sCD4) and to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target the CD4 binding site. Macrophage-tropic R5 Envs were sensitive to sCD4, while non-macrophage-tropic Envs were significantly more resistant. In contrast, all Envs were sensitive to VRC01 regardless of tropism, while MAb b12 conferred an intermediate neutralization pattern where all the macrophage-tropic and about half of the non-macrophage-tropic Envs were sensitive. CD4, b12, and VRC01 share binding specificities on the outer domain of gp120. However, these antibodies differ in their ability to induce conformational changes on the trimeric envelope and in specificity for residues on the V1V2 loop stem and \\u03b220-21 junction that are targets for CD4 in recruiting the bridging sheet. These distinct specificities of CD4, b12, and VRC01 likely explain the observed differences in Env sensitivity to inhibition by these reagents and provide an insight into the envelope mechanisms that control macrophage tropism. We present a model where the efficiency of bridging-sheet recruitment by CD4 is a major determinant of HIV-1 R5 envelope sensitivity to soluble CD4 and macrophage tropism.\",\"We present a case of sexual transmission of HIV-1 predicted to have CXCR4-tropism during male-to-male sexual exposure. Phylogenetic analyses exclude cell-free virus in the seminal plasma of the source partner and possibly point to the seminal cells as the origin of the transmission event.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein provides the primary contact between the virus and host, and is the main target of the adaptive humoral immune response. The length of gp120 variable loops and the number of N-linked glycosylation events are key determinants for virus infectivity and immune escape, while the V3 loop overall positive charge is known to affect co-receptor tropism. We selected two families in which both parents and two children had been infected with HIV-1 for nearly 10 years, but who demonstrated variable parameters of disease progression. We analysed the gp120 envelope sequence and compared individuals that progressed to those that did not in order to decipher evolutionary alterations that are associated with disease progression when individuals are infected with genetically related virus strains. The analysis of the V3-positive charge demonstrated an association between higher V3-positive charges with disease progression. The ratio between the amino acid length and the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites was also shown to be associated with disease progression with the healthier family members having a lower ratio. In conclusion in individuals initially infected with genetically linked virus strains the V3-positive charges and N-linked glycosylation are associated with HIV-1 disease progression and follow varied evolutionary paths for individuals with varied disease progression.\",\"The mechanism by which HIV infection transforms into AIDS disease is unclear. Several factors such as the decline in immune response, increase in replication rate, Syncytium inducing capacity and ability of the viruses to infect tumour cell lines are found to be associated with HIV progression to AIDS. What has not been investigated is the role of an increase in affinity for the CD4+ T cells by the HIV-1 T cell lymphocyte-loving (T-tropic) viruses. They are known to be mutants of the Macrophage-loving (M-tropic) viruses and dominate the late stage of the HIV infection in the disease progression. To elucidate the mechanism by which HIV is transformed into AIDS, this role is examined by using the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM). This is achieved by comparing the degree of affinity between the host CD4 and the gp120 from the HIV-1 M-tropic and HIV-1 T-tropic viruses as well as the isolates of HIV-2 and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The results reveal that only HIV-1 T-tropic viruses bind effectively to the CD4 suggesting that T-tropic viruses, which were identified to have mutated from the M-tropic viruses, acquire enhanced and long-lasting attachment to the CD4. This sustained affinity brings about continued attack on the diminishing CD4 until the immune system of the host collapses, which manifests clinically as AIDS. The findings therefore suggest an approach that should target the Variable region 3 (V3) of the HIV-1 gp120 at the early stage of the infection as a part of the HIV/AIDS management procedure. This procedure is essential as early initiation of HIV/AIDS therapy is generally assumed to prevent the spread of the virus and deterioration of the host immunity. The study is expected to help better understand the HIV pathogenesis and re-strategise pharmaceutical approaches to designing new HIV/AIDS therapeutic interventions.\",\"To address the ability of a 24-week Maraviroc (MVC) intensification of a stable antiretroviral therapy (cART) to significantly increase the CD4 cell count slope. Patients were eligible if they had CD4 <350 cells/mm, a CD4 slope <50 cells/mm per year, and sustained plasma HIV-RNA <50 copies/mL over the last 2 years, while receiving a stable cART. Patients harboring pure X4-using viruses by a phenotypic tropism assay were excluded. MVC was added to cART for 24 weeks, at the recommended dosage per drug-drug interactions. The primary endpoint was a significant positive difference in CD4 slopes (with MVC- pre-MVC, paired t test). Sixty patients (55 men), with median age 51 years, baseline CD4 238 cells/mm, and slope before intensification +14.1 cells/mm per year were included. CD4 nadir was <50/mm in 47% of the population. The full set of patients (N = 57) completed week 24, and the on-treatment patients (N = 48) did not discontinue MVC. The median CD4 slope difference from baseline was +22.6 cells/mm per year (P = 0.08) in full set and +22.6 cells/mm per year (P = 0.04) in on-treatment. Slope evolution was not different according to baseline tropism, CD4 nadir, or ongoing cART regimen. No drug-related severe adverse events were recorded during intensification. MVC plasma concentrations were significantly different depending on drug-drug interaction with ongoing cART regimen and tended to be correlated with CD4 cells increase. In this study, MVC intensification of stable cART over 24 weeks was able to enhance CD4 cell slopes in patients with prior insufficient immune restoration despite long-term virological control.\",\"Transmission of HIV-1 during breastfeeding is a significant source of new pediatric infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Breast milk from HIV-positive mothers contains both cell-free and cell-associated virus; however, the impact of breast milk on HIV-1 infectivity remains poorly understood. In the present study, breast milk was collected from HIV-positive and HIV-negative Tanzanian women attending antenatal clinics in Dar es Salaam. Milk was analyzed for activity in vitro against both cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1. Potent inhibition of cell-free R5 and X4 HIV-1 occurred in the presence of milk from all donors regardless of HIV-1 serostatus. Inhibition of cell-free HIV-1 infection positively correlated with milk levels of sialyl-Lewis(X) from HIV-positive donors. In contrast, milk from 8 of 16 subjects enhanced infection with cell-associated HIV-1 regardless of donor serostatus. Milk from two of these subjects contained high levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\\u03b1, IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1\\u03b1, MIP-1\\u03b2, MCP-1 and IP-10, and enhanced cell-associated HIV-1 infection at dilutions as high as 1\\u2236500. These findings indicate that breast milk contains innate factors with divergent activity against cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in vitro. Enhancement of cell-associated HIV-1 infection by breast milk may be associated with inflammatory conditions in the mother and may contribute to infant infection during breastfeeding.\",\"HIV type 1 (HIV-1) replicates preferentially in IL-4-producing CD4 T cells for unclear reasons. We show increased HIV-1 expression is irrespective of viral tropism for chemokine receptors as previously suggested, but rather transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is increased in IL-4-producing CD4 T cells. Increased expression of HIV-1 message is also confirmed in IL-4-producing CD4 T cells from HIV-1-infected individuals ex vivo. In exploring a transcriptional mechanism, we identify a novel c-maf (required for IL-4 expression) transcription factor binding site just upstream of the dual NF-\\u03baB/NFAT binding sites in the proximal HIV-1 LTR. We demonstrate that c-maf binds this site in vivo and synergistically augments HIV-1 transcription in cooperation with NFAT2 and NF-\\u03baB p65, but not NFAT1 or NF-\\u03baB p50. Conversely, small interfering RNA inhibition of c-maf reduces HIV-1 transcription in IL-4-producing T cells. Thus, c-maf increases HIV-1 expression in IL-4-producing CD4 T cells by binding the proximal HIV-1 LTR and augmenting HIV-1 transcription in partnership with NFAT2 and NF-\\u03baB p65 specifically. This has important implications for selective targeting of transcription factors during HIV-1 infection because, over the course of HIV-1 progression/AIDS, IL-4-producing T cells frequently predominate and substantially contribute to disease pathology.\",\"DNA nanoparticles (DNA NPs), which self-assemble from DNA plasmids and poly-L-lysine (pLL)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) block copolymers, transfect several cell types in vitro and in vivo with minimal toxicity and immune response. To further enhance the gene transfer efficiency of DNA NP and control its tropism, we established a strategy to efficiently attach peptide ligands to DNA NPs. The non-covalent biotin-streptavidin (SA) interaction was used for ligand conjugation to overcome problems associated with covalent conjugation methods. A fusion protein of SA with the HIV-1 TAT peptide was cloned, expressed, purified and attached to biotinylated DNA NPs. A modified SA system with tetrameric structure but monovalent biotin binding capacity was adopted and shown to reduce the aggregation of biotinylated DNA NPs compared to neutravidin. Compared to unmodified DNA NPs, TAT modified DNA NPs significantly enhanced in vitro gene transfer, particularly at low DNA concentrations. Studies of cellular uptake and cellular distribution of the DNA NPs indicated that attaching TAT enhanced binding of DNA NPs to cell surface but not internalization at high DNA concentrations. In vivo studies showed that TAT modified DNA NPs mediated equal level of gene transfer to the mouse airways via the luminal route compared to unmodified DNA NPs.\",\"Although CCR5 and CXCR4 are the predominant coreceptors associated with HIV-1 entry, many more coreceptors can support either infection or viral capture and have been associated with transmission and disease progression. Here, we describe the most recent findings pertinent to which receptors are involved with HIV-1 infection and the proposed consequences. CCR5 or CXCR4 using HIV-1 can differentially utilize their respective coreceptors and influence which cell types are infected. Many alternate coreceptors have been described which expands the pool of cells within which HIV-1 can replicate or reside. A large number of C-type lectins have been described which capture HIV-1 and present the virus to CD4 T cells which can also be considered as receptors involved with transmission or disease course. The molecular mechanism through which gp120 binds host lectins, such as altered N-linked glycosylation profiling, provides further mechanisms influencing HIV-1 capture and transfer. Genetic polymorphisms within the alternative coreceptors have now been shown to associate with disease, implying they can play a significant role in HIV-1 disease. We have summarized the recent findings concerning the multitude of receptors and coreceptors which can interact with HIV-1 and have discussed the consequences for either HIV-1 transmission or disease progression.\",\" CCR5 antagonists have clinically been approved for prevention or treatment of HIV/AIDS. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with the highest burden of HIV/AIDS are due to adopt these regimens. However, HIV-1 can also use CXCR4 as a co-receptor. There is hence an urgent need to map out cellular tropism of a country's circulating HIV strains to guide the impending use of CCR5 antagonists. To determine HIV-1 coreceptor usage among patients attending a comprehensive care centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Blood samples were obtained from HIV infected patients attending the comprehensive care centre, Kenyatta National Hospital in years 2008 and 2009. The samples were separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Proviral DNA was extracted from PBMCs and Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) done to amplify the HIV env fragment spanning the C2-V3 region. The resultant fragment was directly sequenced on an automated sequencer (ABI, 3100). Co-receptor prediction of the env sequences was done using Geno2pheno  [co-receptor], and phylogenetic relationships determined using CLUSTALW and Neighbor Joining method. A total of 67 samples (46 treatment experienced and 21 treatment naive) were successfully amplified and sequenced. Forty nine (73%) sequences showed a prediction for R5 tropism while 18(27%) were X4 tropic. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 46(69%) were subtype A, 11(16%) subtype C, and 10(15%) subtype D. No statistical significant associations were observed between cell tropism and CD4+ status, patient gender, age, or treatment option. There was a tendency for more X4 tropic strains being in the treatment experienced group than the naive group: Of 46 treatment experiencing participants, 14(30%) harboured X4, compared with 4(19%) of 21 of the treatment-na\\u00efve participants, the association is however not statistically significant (p\\u2009=\\u20090.31). However, a strong association was observed between subtype D and CXCR4 co- receptor usage (p\\u2009=\\u20090.015) with 6(60%) of the 10 subtype D being X4 tropic and 4(40%) R5 tropic. HIV-1 R5 tropic strains were the most prevalent in the study population and HIV infected patients in Kenya may benefit from CCR5 antagonists. However, there is need for caution where subtype D infection is suspected or where antiretroviral salvage therapy is indicated.\",\"HIV-1 enters CD4-expressing cells via one or both of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Specific CCR5 antagonists are now in clinical use, but only for CCR5-tropic viruses. Hence, several methods have been developed for assessing HIV-1 tropism in patients who are candidates for CCR5 antagonists. This article reviews current data on phenotypic assays of tropism. Phenotypic assays are still used as reference, although genotypic methods have improved. The main advantages of phenotypic assays are their great sensitivity for detecting minor CXCR4-using variants and their capacity to assess non-B subtypes of HIV-1. Clinical trials of maraviroc have, thus, relied on the phenotypic determination of HIV-1 tropism. However, new genotypic approaches that are more sensitive for minor CXCR4-using variants, notably ultra-deep pyrosequencing, are now challenging phenotypic assays. Nevertheless, phenotypic assays are essential for improving genotypic algorithms for determining HIV-1 tropism as well as for assessing the resistance of R5-tropic viruses to CCR5 antagonists. HIV-1 tropism should be determined before using CCR5 antagonists. Phenotypic recombinant assays are still the benchmark tests for characterizing HIV-1 tropism as their great sensitivity enables them to detect minor CXCR4-using variants of both B and non-B HIV-1 subtypes.\",\"HIV-1 infects tissue macrophages, microglia and other mononuclear phagocytes which represent an important cellular reservoir for viral replication and persistence in macrophage-rich tissue. This compartmentalization allows the virus to exist as genetically distinct quasi-species that can have capacities to use different coreceptors for cell entry. This review assesses the tropism of HIV-1 in different human compartments. The majority of HIV infection occurs with R5-tropic viruses probably due to the selective expression of the R5 cell-surface protein on the target cells in the genital muscosa. There is a large concordance of tropism use between blood cell-associated proviral DNA and RNA plasma viruses, allowing the use of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonists in patients who have undetectable viral load and for whom HIV tropism was determined in DNA. Most of HIV strains in central nervous system remain R5-tropic allowing the use of CCR5 antagonists. There are many clinical situations in which the use of CCR5 antagonists can be used and several ways to determine HIV tropism in most of the compartments.\",\"Entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into the host cell involves interactions between the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and the cellular receptor CD4 as well as a coreceptor molecule (most importantly CCR5 or CXCR4). Viral preference for a specific coreceptor (tropism) is in particular determined by the third variable loop (V3) of the Env glycoprotein gp120. The approval and use of a coreceptor antagonist for antiretroviral therapy make detailed understanding of tropism and its accurate prediction from patient derived virus isolates essential. The aim of the present study is the development of an extended description of the HIV entry phenotype reflecting its co-dependence on several key determinants as the basis for a more accurate prediction of HIV-1 entry phenotype from genotypic data. Here, we established a new protocol of quantitation and computational analysis of the dependence of HIV entry efficiency on receptor and coreceptor cell surface levels as well as viral V3 loop sequence and the presence of two prototypic coreceptor antagonists in varying concentrations. Based on data collected at the single-cell level, we constructed regression models of the HIV-1 entry phenotype integrating the measured determinants. We developed a multivariate phenotype descriptor, termed phenotype vector, which facilitates a more detailed characterization of HIV entry phenotypes than currently used binary tropism classifications. For some of the tested virus variants, the multivariant phenotype vector revealed substantial divergences from existing tropism predictions. We also developed methods for computational prediction of the entry phenotypes based on the V3 sequence and performed an extrapolating calculation of the effectiveness of this computational procedure. Our study of the HIV cell entry phenotype and the novel multivariate representation developed here contributes to a more detailed understanding of this phenotype and offers potential for future application in the effective administration of entry inhibitors in antiretroviral therapies.\",\"Vicriviroc (VCV), a small-molecule antagonist of the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), blocks HIV's entry into CD4+ cells. Small studies have suggested that resistance to CCR5 antagonists is slow to develop. To examine resistance to VCV in isolates from treatment experienced patients who experienced virologic failure in two phase 3 trials. Genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility to VCV, and other antiretroviral drugs were evaluated at baseline and at defined intervals during the study. In a post hoc analysis, viral tropism at baseline was evaluated using the Trofile-ES assay. Only subjects with R5-tropic virus were included in the analysis. Viral envelope sequencing was performed on samples from subjects with emergent VCV resistance defined using a relative MPI cutoff. 71/486 subjects treated with VCV for 48 weeks met the protocol-defined virologic failure criteria. 7/71 (10%) had DM/X4 virus at the time of virologic failure; VCV resistance was identified in 4/486 treated subjects (1%). No control subject had detectable DM/X4 virus or VCV resistance at virologic failure. Clonal analysis of envelope sequences from VCV-resistant virus identified 2-5 amino acid substitutions at or near the crown of the V3 loop; however, no signature V3 mutations were identified. Changes outside the V3 loop were also observed in resistant clones; no consistent variant pattern was observed. In these trials, use of a sensitive tropism assay and potent antiretroviral drug combinations contributed to the infrequent detection of X4-tropic virus and VCV resistance. Substitutions in the V3 loop were associated with VCV resistance, however, no specific pattern of amino acid changes were sufficient to reliably predict VCV susceptibility.\",\"This is a comparative study of HIV co-receptor usage in the early stages of HIV infection between two distinct patient groups, one with a low CD4 count (group 1), and the other with a high CD4 count (group 2). Group 1 progressed to a CD4 count below 200 cells/\\u03bcL within 2 y, while group 2 had a CD4 count above 500 cells/\\u03bcL within 2 y. Viral RNA was extracted from the plasma of these patients, and the C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env genes were cloned and sequenced. The co-receptor usage was predicated based on V3 loop amino acid sequences using Geno2pheno and PSSM programs. Our results indicate that in acute HIV infection of rapid progressors (low CD4 count; group 1), the primary co-receptor usage is CXCR4, while in the high CD4 count group (group 2), the co-receptor usage is predominantly CCR5. One-year follow-up data from these patients showed no obvious change in HIV co-receptor usage in either group. Sequence analysis of patients from both study groups showed prevalence of the AE subtype, and therefore we can speculate that the CXCR4 co-receptor may be the primary HIV-1 co-receptor used in the HIV-1 AE subtype, and may be responsible for rapid HIV-1 disease progression in the MSM cohort.\",\"A xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) has been reported to be an emerging pathogen associated with prostate cancer (PC) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, recent studies have demonstrated that XMRV is a laboratory-derived virus resulting from genetic recombination between two mouse viral genomes during serial xenograft tissue transplantation. This study describes a phylogenetic analysis that compared XMRV with the ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (E-MLV), xenotropic MLV (X-MLV), and other retroviruses, including HTLV-1 and HIV-1. We found that sequences corresponding to three XMRV structural proteins (Env, Gag, and Pol) exhibited high degrees of homology with X-MLV (>91 %) and E-MLV (67-96 %), but not HTLV-1 (13-16 %) or HIV-1 (10-15 %), indicating that XMRV was derived from X-MLV and/or E-MLV. We then compared the infectivity of XMRV and E-MLV for human and murine lymphocytes, respectively. Results showed that human PBMCs were not susceptible to XMRV infection, suggesting that XMRV exhibits host cell tropism similar to E-MLV that only infects murine PBMCs. These data suggest that it is unlikely that this laboratory-generated retrovirus could cause disease in humans.\",\"HIV infection usually leads to a progressive decline in number and functionality of CD4+ T lymphocytes, resulting in AIDS development. In this study, I investigated the strategy of using inoculated SupT1 cells to move infection from HIV-1 X4 strains toward the inoculated cells, which should theoretically prevent infection and depletion of normal CD4+ T cells, preventing the development of AIDS-related pathologies. Interestingly, the persistent in vitro replication in SupT1 cells renders the virus less cytopathic and more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization, suggesting that replication of the virus in the inoculated SupT1 cells may have a vaccination effect in the long run. In order to mimic the scenario of a therapy in which SupT1 cells are inoculated in an HIV-seropositive patient, I used infected SupT1/PBMC cocultures and a series of control experiments. Infections were done with equal amounts of the wild type HIV-1 LAI virus. The SupT1 CD4+CD8+ T cell population was distinguished from the PBMC CD4+CD8- T cell population by FACS analysis. The results of this study show that the virus-mediated killing of primary CD4+ T cells in the SupT1/PBMC cocultures was significantly delayed, suggesting that the preferential infection of SupT1 cells can induce the virus to spare primary CD4+ T cells from infection and depletion. The preferential infection of SupT1 cells can be explained by the higher viral tropism for the SupT1 cell line. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that it's possible in an in vitro system to use SupT1 cells to prevent HIV infection of primary CD4+ T cells, suggesting that further exploration of the SupT1 cell line as a cell-based therapy against HIV-1 may prove worthwhile.\",\"To study the use of major and alternative coreceptors by HIV-1 isolates obtained from paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Paired plasma and CSF isolates from HIV-1-infected individuals with varying clinical, virologic, and immunologic parameters were assessed for the ability to infect indicator cells expressing a panel of coreceptors with documented expression in the central nervous system (CNS). HIV-1 isolates obtained from plasma and CSF in 28 individuals with varying viral load, CD4 T-cell counts, and with or without AIDS-defining disease were analyzed for the ability to infect NP2.CD4 cells stably expressing a panel of HIV coreceptors (CCR5, CXCR4, CCR3, CXCR6, GPR1, APJ, ChemR23, RDC-1 or BLT1). All isolates from both plasma and CSF utilized CCR5 and/or CXCR4. However, the ability to use both CCR3 and CCR5 (R3R5) was more pronounced in CSF isolates and correlated with high CSF viral load and low CD4 T-cell count. Notably, four out of five CSF isolates of subtype C origin exhibited CXCR6 use, which coincided with high CSF viral load despite preserved CD4 T-cell counts. The use of other alternative coreceptors was less pronounced. Dual-tropic R3R5 HIV-1 isolates in CSF coincide with high CSF viral load and low CD4 T-cell counts. Frequent CXCR6 use by CSF-derived subtype C isolates indicates that subtype-specific differences in coreceptor use may exist that will not be acknowledged when assessing plasma virus isolates. The findings may also bare relevance for HIV-1 replication within the CNS, and consequently, for the neuropathogenesis of AIDS.\",\"Sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) most often results from productive infection by a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, indicating a stringent mucosal bottleneck. Understanding the viral traits that overcome this bottleneck could have important implications for HIV-1 vaccine design and other prevention strategies. Most T/F viruses use CCR5 to infect target cells and some encode envelope glycoproteins (Envs) that contain fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites and shorter V1/V2 variable loops than Envs from chronic viruses. Moreover, it has been reported that the gp120 subunits of certain transmitted Envs bind to the gut-homing integrin \\u03b14\\u03b27, possibly enhancing virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. Here we sought to determine whether subtype C T/F viruses, which are responsible for the majority of new HIV-1 infections worldwide, share biological properties that increase their transmission fitness, including preferential \\u03b14\\u03b27 engagement. Using single genome amplification, we generated panels of both T/F (n\\u200a=\\u200a20) and chronic (n\\u200a=\\u200a20) Env constructs as well as full-length T/F (n\\u200a=\\u200a6) and chronic (n\\u200a=\\u200a4) infectious molecular clones (IMCs). We found that T/F and chronic control Envs were indistinguishable in the efficiency with which they used CD4 and CCR5. Both groups of Envs also exhibited the same CD4+ T cell subset tropism and showed similar sensitivity to neutralization by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies. Finally, saturating concentrations of anti-\\u03b14\\u03b27 antibodies failed to inhibit infection and replication of T/F as well as chronic control viruses, although the growth of the tissue culture-adapted strain SF162 was modestly impaired. These results indicate that the population bottleneck associated with mucosal HIV-1 acquisition is not due to the selection of T/F viruses that use \\u03b14\\u03b27, CD4 or CCR5 more efficiently.\",\"Through this study we evaluated whether the HIV-1 tropism determined by genotypic analysis correlates with HIV-1 markers, such as CD4 cell count and plasma HIV-RNA. The analysis was performed on 1221 HIV-1 B-subtype infected patients with an available V3 sequence (all maraviroc naive). Of them, 532 were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive and 689 ART experienced. Tropism determination was performed by using the geno2pheno (co-receptor) algorithm set at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10% and 2%. Potential associations of FPR with CD4 cell count and viraemia were evaluated. Association of V3 mutations with genotypic-determined tropism was also evaluated according to different FPR ranges. About 26% of patients (either ART naive or ART experienced) were infected by X4-tropic viruses (using the classical 10% FPR cut-off). However, a significantly lower proportion of ART-naive patients had FPR \\u2264 2% in comparison with ART-experienced patients (4.9% vs. 12.6%, respectively, p <0.001). The risk of advanced HIV-1 infection (with CD4 cell count \\u2264 200 cells/mm(3)) was significantly greater in X4-infected patients, either ART-naive (OR (95% CI)), 4.2 (1.8-9.2); p 0.0006) or ART-experienced (2.3 (1.4-3.6); p 0.0003), with FPR set at 2% (but not at 10%). This finding was confirmed by multivariable logistic analysis. No relationship was found between viraemia and FPR \\u22642%. Some X4-related mutations were significantly associated with FPR \\u22642% (ART-naive patients, S11R, Y21V, G24K and G24R, p \\u22640.001; ART-experienced patients, Y7K, S11R, H13Y, p \\u22640.002). In conclusion, these findings show that within the context of genotypically-assessed CXCR4 tropism, FPR \\u22642% defines (far better than 10%-FPR) a viral population associated with low CD4 rank, with potentially greater cytopathic effect, and with more advanced disease.\",\"Current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 pandemic is believed to originate from cross-species transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) into human population. Such cross-species transmission, however, is not efficient in general, because viral replication is modulated by host cell factors, with the species-specificity of these factors affecting viral tropism. An understanding of those host cell factors that affect viral replication contributes to elucidation of the mechanism for determination of viral tropism. This review will focus an anti-viral effect of ApoB mRNA editing catalytic subunit, tripartite motif protein 5 alpha, and cyclophilins on SIV replication and provide insight into the mechanism of species-specific barriers against viral infection in human cells. It will then present our current understanding of the mechanism that may explain zoonotic transmission of retroviruses.\",\"We have previously demonstrated intrinsic anti-HIV activity in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from HIV-infected women with high CD4 counts and not on antiretroviral therapy. However, the impact of HIV disease progression on CVL innate immune responses has not been delineated. CVL from 57 HIV-infected women not on antiretroviral therapy were collected by washing the cervicovaginal area with 10 ml of sterile normal saline. We characterized subject HIV disease progression by CD4 count strata: >500 cells/\\u00b5l, 200-500 cells/\\u00b5l, or <200 cells/\\u00b5l of blood. To assess CVL anti-HIV activity, we incubated TZM-bl cells with HIV plus or minus CVL. Antimicrobials, cytokines, chemokines and anti-gp160 HIV IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA and Luminex. CVL exhibited broad anti-HIV activity against multiple laboratory-adapted and transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses, with anti-HIV activity ranging from 0 to 100% showing wide variation between viral strains. Although there was broad CVL inhibition of most both laboratory-adapted and T/F virus strains, there was practically no inhibition of T/F strain RHPA.c, which was isolated from a woman newly infected via heterosexual intercourse. HIV disease progression, measured by declining CD4 T cell counts, resulted in a selective reduction in intrinsic anti-HIV activity in CVL that paralleled CVL decreases in human beta-defensin 2 and increases in Elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. HIV disease progress predicted decreased CVL anti-HIV activity against both laboratory-adapted and T/F strains of HIV. Anti-HIV activity exhibited close associations with CVL levels of fourteen cytokines and chemokines. Amid a multifaceted immune defense against HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted pathogens, HIV disease progression is associated with selective disturbances in both CVL anti-HIV activity and specific innate immune defenses in the human female reproductive tract (FRT). Overall, these studies indicate that innate immune protection in the FRT is compromised as women progress to AIDS.\",\"Lentiviral vectors are at the forefront of gene delivery systems for research and clinical applications. These vectors have the ability to efficiently transduce nondividing and dividing cells, to insert large genetic segment in the host chromatin, and to sustain stable long-term transgene expression. Most of lentiviral vectors systems in use are derived from HIV-1. Numerous modifications in the basic HIV structure have been made to ensure safety and to promote efficiency to vectors. Lentiviral vectors can be pseudotyped with distinct viral envelopes that influence vector tropism and transduction efficiency. Moreover, these vectors can be used to reprogram cells and generate induced pluripotent stem cells. This review aims to show the patents that resulted in improved safety and efficacy of lentiviral vector with important implications for clinical trials.\",\"Efficient gene delivery in the central nervous system (CNS) is important in studying gene functions, modeling neurological diseases and developing therapeutic approaches. Lentiviral vectors are attractive tools in transduction of neurons and other cell types in CNS as they transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, support sustained expression of transgenes, and have relatively large packaging capacity and low toxicity. Lentiviral vectors have been successfully used in transducing many neural cell types in vitro and in animals. Great efforts have been made to develop lentiviral vectors with improved biosafety and efficiency for gene delivery. The current third generation replication-defective and self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors are depicted in Figure 1. The required elements for vector packaging are split into four plasmids. In the lentiviral transfer plasmid, the U3 region in the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) is replaced with a strong promoter from another virus. This modification allows the transcription of the vector sequence independent of HIV-1 Tat protein that is normally required for HIV gene expression. The packaging signal (\\u03a8) is essential for encapsidation and the Rev-responsive element (RRE) is required for producing high titer vectors. The central polypurine tract (cPPT) is important for nuclear import of the vector DNA, a feature required for transducing non-dividing cells. In the 3' LTR, the cis-regulatory sequences are completely removed from the U3 region. This deletion is copied to 5' LTR after reverse transcription, resulting in transcriptional inactivation of both LTRs. Plasmid pMDLg/pRRE contains HIV-1 gag/pol genes, which provide structural proteins and reverse transcriptase. pRSV-Rev encodes Rev which binds to the RRE for efficient RNA export from the nucleus. pCMV-G encodes the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) that replaces HIV-1 Env. VSV-G expands the tropism of the vectors and allows concentration via ultracentrifugation. All the genes encoding the accessory proteins, including Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef are excluded in the packaging system. The production and manipulation of lentiviral vectors should be carried out according to NIH guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA (http://oba.od.nih.gov/oba/rac/Guidelines/NIH_Guidelines.pdf). An approval from individual Institutional Biological and Chemical Safety Committee may be required before using lentiviral vectors. Lentiviral vectors are commonly produced by cotransfection of 293T cells with lentiviral transfer plasmid and the helper plasmids encoding the proteins required for vector packaging. Many lentiviral transfer plasmids and helper plasmids can be obtained from Addgene, a non-profit plasmid repository (http://www.addgene.org/). Some stable packaging cell lines have been developed, but these systems provide less flexibility and their packaging efficiency generally declines over time. Commercially available transfection kits may support high efficiency of transfection, but they can be very expensive for large scale vector preparations. Calcium phosphate precipitation methods provide highly efficient transfection of 293T cells and thus provide a reliable and cost effective approach for lentiviral vector production. In this protocol, we produce lentiviral vectors by cotransfection of 293T cells with four plasmids based on the calcium phosphate precipitation principle, followed by purification and concentration with ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. The vector titers are determined by fluorescence- activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or by real time qPCR. The production and titration of lentiviral vectors in this protocol can be finished with 9 days. We provide an example of transducing these vectors into murine neocortical cultures containing both neurons and astrocytes. We demonstrate that lentiviral vectors support high efficiency of transduction and cell type-specific gene expression in primary cultured cells from CNS.\",\"BMS-663068 is the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of BMS-626529, a novel small-molecule attachment inhibitor that targets HIV-1 gp120 and prevents its binding to CD4(+) T cells. The activity of BMS-626529 is virus dependent, due to heterogeneity within gp120. In order to better understand the anti-HIV-1 spectrum of BMS-626529 against HIV-1, in vitro activities against a wide variety of laboratory strains and clinical isolates were determined. BMS-626529 had half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) values of <10 nM against the vast majority of viral isolates; however, susceptibility varied by >6 log(10), with half-maximal effective concentration values in the low pM range against the most susceptible viruses. The in vitro antiviral activity of BMS-626529 was generally not associated with either tropism or subtype, with few exceptions. Measurement of the binding affinity of BMS-626529 for purified gp120 suggests that a contributory factor to its inhibitory potency may be a relatively long dissociative half-life. Finally, in two-drug combination studies, BMS-626529 demonstrated additive or synergistic interactions with antiretroviral drugs of different mechanistic classes. These results suggest that BMS-626529 should be active against the majority of HIV-1 viruses and support the continued clinical development of the compound.\",\"We analyzed the evolution of viral tropism after 8 days of maraviroc monotherapy, i.e., we used the maraviroc clinical test (MCT), in 21 patients with and 14 without virological response to the drug (MCT(+) and MCT(-) patients, respectively). No increases in CXCR4 inferred viral loads (X4IVLs) were observed in MCT(+) patients, while X4IVLs increased only in MCT(-) patients, with X4IVLs of >2 log(10) HIV RNA copies/ml. These results shed light on the evolution of viral tropism under a CCR5 antagonist in vivo.\",\"The discovery of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) as a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor opened a new avenue to exploit CCR5 as a potential target for the intervention of HIV-1's cellular entry. Various small-molecule CCR5 inhibitors were identified in the last decade; however, maraviroc (MVC) is the only CCR5 inhibitor currently used in the clinic. Concerns and challenges that exist for wider clinical use of CCR5 inhibitors are discussed. Although MVC-containing regimens have been recommended for treatment-na\\u00efve patients, MVC appears to have been used as one of drugs for salvage therapy rather than for treating drug-na\\u00efve patients. This is apparently due to MVC's twice-daily dosing schedule. Another significant disadvantage is that a costly tropism assay must be performed prior to MVC treatment. The access to inexpensive, sensitive, and rapid tropism tests should be made easily available. Only a few novel CCR5 inhibitors are presently in the pipeline. Development of potent and metabolically-stable novel CCR5 inhibitors allowing once-daily dosing regimens is needed. Development of CXCR4 inhibitors should greatly improve the treatment options available to patients infected with X4- and/or dual-tropic HIV-1 strains in combination with a CCR5 inhibitor.\",\"Since HIV-1 Tat has been associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, we investigated 60 HIV-1 subtype B-infected individuals who were characterized for neurocognitive functioning and had paired CSF and blood plasma samples available. To avoid issues with repeated sampling, we generated population-based HIV-1 tat sequences from each compartment and evaluated these data using a battery of phylogenetic, statistical, and machine learning tools. These analyses identified position HXB2 5905 within the cysteine-rich domain of tat as a signature of CSF-derived HIV-1, and a higher number of mixed bases in CSF, as measure of diversity, was associated with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Since identified mutations were synonymous, we evaluated the predicted secondary RNA structures, which showed that this mutation altered secondary structure. As a measure of divergence, the genetic distance between the blood and CSF-derived tat was inversely correlated with current and nadir CD4+ T cell counts. These data suggest that specific HIV-1 features of tat influence neurotropism and neurocognitive impairment.\",\"To analyse the transmigration of immune cells infected by HIV-1 across the epithelial monolayer using the endometrial human endometrial carcinoma (HEC)-1A cell line and to study the influence of seminal plasma in this process. After sexual intercourse involving a male partner infected by HIV-1, a selection process has been shown to lead to a predominant transmission of the R5 phenotype despite the presence of X4 and R5 strains in semen. Transmigration of HIV-infected monocytes present in semen may represent a pertinent mechanism that could explain this tropism selection. Epithelial monolayer crossing was studied by using HEC-1A epithelial cells cultured on permeable support and monocyte-enriched or lymphocyte-enriched populations of cells infected or not by HIV R5 or X4 strains. Transmigrating cells were quantified and analysed for their ability to transmit HIV infection to immune target cells. The effect of HIV-negative seminal plasma on cell transmigration was analysed. A preferential passage of the R5 strain associated with monocyte-enriched populations was observed together with the ability of this strain to transmit infection. Seminal plasma was found able to decrease the epithelial crossing of immune cells by enhancing transepithelial resistance and by increasing the adherence of immune cells to the monolayer. The preferential transmigration of HIV R5 strains associated with monocytes across the endocervical monolayer may explain the predominant transmission of the R5 strains after sexual intercourse. By its capacity to modulate the tightness of the epithelial structure, seminal plasma reinforces this selection process.\",\"Foamy virus (FV) vector systems have recently demonstrated their power as efficient gene transfer tools for different target tissues. Unfortunately, FVs cannot be naturally pseudotyped by heterologous viral glycoproteins due to an unusual particle morphogenesis involving a FV Env-dependent particle release process. Therefore, current FV vector systems are constrained to the broad host cell range provided by the cognate viral glycoprotein. We evaluated different approaches for pseudotyping of FV vectors, in which the specific FV Gag-Env interaction, essential for particle egress, is substituted by a small-molecule controlled heterodimerization (HD) system. In one system developed, one HD-domain (HDD) is fused to a membrane-targeting domain (MTD), such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag matrix (MA) subunit, with a second fused to the FV capsid protein. Coexpression of both components with different heterologous viral glycoproteins allowed an efficient, dimerizer-dependent pseudotyping of FV capsids. With this system FV vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotype titers greater than 1 \\u00d7 10(6) IU/ml were obtained, at levels comparable to authentic FV vector particles. As a proof-of-principle we demonstrate that Pac2 cells, naturally resistant to FV vectors, become permissive to FV VSV-G pseudotypes. Similar to other retroviral vectors, this FV pseudotyping system now enables adaptation of cell-specific targeting approaches for FVs.\",\"Transmitted HIV-1 clade B or C R5 viruses have been reported to infect macrophages inefficiently, while other studies have described R5 viruses in late disease with either an enhanced macrophage-tropism or carrying envelopes with an increased positive charge and fitness. In contrast, our previous data suggested that viruses carrying non-macrophage-tropic R5 envelopes were still predominant in immune tissue of AIDS patients. To further investigate the tropism and charge of HIV-1 viruses in late disease, we evaluated the properties of HIV-1 envelopes amplified from immune and brain tissues of AIDS patients with neurological complications. Almost all envelopes amplified were R5. There was clear compartmentalization of envelope sequences for four of the five subjects. However, strong compartmentalization of macrophage-tropism in brain was observed even when brain and immune tissue envelope sequences were not segregated. R5 envelopes from immune tissue of four subjects carried a higher positive charge compared to brain envelopes. We also confirm a significant correlation between macrophage tropism and sensitivity to soluble CD4, a weak association with sensitivity to the CD4 binding site antibody, b12, but no clear relationship with maraviroc sensitivity. Our study shows that non-macrophage-tropic R5 envelopes carrying gp120s with an increased positive charge were predominant in immune tissue in late disease. However, highly macrophage-tropic variants with lower charged gp120s were nearly universal in the brain. These results are consistent with HIV-1 R5 envelopes evolving gp120s with an increased positive charge in immune tissue or sites outside the brain that likely reflect an adaptation for increased replication or fitness for CD4+ T-cells. Our data are consistent with the presence of powerful pressures in brain and in immune tissues selecting for R5 envelopes with very different properties; high macrophage-tropism, sCD4 sensitivity and low positive charge in brain and non-macrophage-tropism, sCD4 resistance and high positive charge in immune tissue.\",\"The DIVA study is aimed at setting up a standardized genotypic tropism-testing on proviral-DNA for the routine clinical diagnostic-laboratory. Twelve local centres and 5 reference centres (previously cross-validated) were identified. For inter-center validation-procedure, 60 peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) aliquots from 45 HAART-treated patients were randomly chosen for population V3 sequencing on proviral-DNA at local HIV centre and at reference-laboratory. Viral tropism was predicted by Geno2Pheno algorithm (False Positive Rate [FPR] = 20%) as proposed by the European-Guidelines. Quantification of total HIV-1 DNA was based on a method described by Viard (2004). Quantification of HIV-1 DNA was available for 35/45 (77.8%) samples, and gave a median value of 598 (IQR:252- 1,203) copies/10 PBMCs. A total of 56/60 (93.3%) samples were successfully amplified by both the reference and the local virological centers. The overall concordance of tropism prediction between local and reference centers was 54/56 (96.4%). Results of tropism prediction by local centers were: 33/54 (61.1%) R5 and 21/54 (38.9%) X4/DM. There was high concordance in the genotypic tropism prediction based on proviral DNA among different virological centers throughout Italy. Our results are in line with other European studies, and support the use of genotypic tropism testing on proviral DNA in patients with suppressed plasma HIV-1 RNA candidate to CCR5-antagonist treatment.\",\"This study compared HIV-1 genotypes shed over time (\\u22643.5 years) in the vaginal secretions (VS) and blood plasma (BP) of 15 chronically infected women. Analysis of predicted coreceptor tropism (CCR5=R5, CXCR4=X4) for quasispecies shedding revealed three patterns: (1) viral quasispecies shed in both VS and BP were restricted to R5-tropism at all time points, (2) quasispecies shed in VS were restricted to R5-tropism at all time points but X4 quasispecies were identified in the BP at one or more time points, and (3) quasispecies shed in matched VS and BP both contained X4-tropic viruses. Overall, the frequency of X4 quasispecies circulation in VS was 2-fold less than in BP and detection of X4 virus in VS was more likely to occur when X4 quasispecies comprised more than 50% of BP viruses (p=0.01) and when declines in blood CD4(+) lymphocyte levels were the greatest (p=0.038). Additionally, the mean number of predicted N-glycosylation sites between matched VS and BP samples was strongly correlated (r=0.86, p<0.0001) with glycosylation densities in the following order (VS R5=BP R5 > BP X4 > VS X4). The X4 glycosylation densities may result from compartmentalization pressures in the female genital tract or the delayed appearance of these viruses in VS. Our results suggest that the presence of X4 virus in VS is associated with a threshold population of X4 quasispecies in BP, which are increasing during the HIV-induced failure of the human immune system.\",\"Retroviruses are useful tools for the efficient delivery of genes to mammalian cells, owing to their ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome. Over the past few decades, retroviral vectors have been used in gene therapy clinical trials for the treatment of a number of inherited diseases and cancers. The earliest retrovirus vectors were based on simple oncogenic gammaretroviruses such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) which, when pseudotyped with envelope proteins from other viruses such as the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope protein (GALV) or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), can efficiently introduce genes to a wide range of host cells. However, gammaretroviral vectors have the disadvantage that they are unable to efficiently transduce nondividing or slowly dividing cells. As a result, specific protocols have been developed to activate cells through the use of growth factors and cytokines. In the case of hematopoietic stem cells, activation has to be carefully controlled so that pluripotency is maintained. For many applications, gammaretroviral vectors are being superseded by lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) which has additional accessory proteins that enable integration in the absence of cell division. In addition, retroviral and lentiviral vector design has evolved to address a number of safety concerns. These include separate expression of the viral genes in trans to prevent recombination events leading to the generation of replication-competent viruses. Further, the development of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors reduces the potential for transactivation of neighboring genes and allows the incorporation of regulatory elements that may target gene expression more physiologically to particular cell types.\",\"Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of HIV-1 have been identified in southern China in recent years. CRF08_BC is one of the most predominant subtypes circulating in China. In order to study HIV subtype biology and to provide a tool for biotechnological applications, the first full-length replication-competent infectious molecular clone harboring CRF08_BC is reported. The construction of this clone pBRGX indicates that a moderate-copy number vector is required for its amplification in E. coli. In addition, it is shown that the parental CRF08_BC LTRs are important for generating this efficient replication-competent infectious clone. These observations may aid in the construction of infectious clones from other subtypes. Both the pBRGX-derived virus and its parental isolate contain CCR5 tropism. Their full-length genomes were also sequenced, analyzed, compared and deposited in GenBank (JF719819 and JF719818, respectively). The availability of pBRGX as the first replication-competent molecular clone of CRF08_BC provides a useful tool for a wide range of studies of this newly emergent HIV subtype, including the development of HIV vaccine candidates, antiviral drug screening and drug resistance analysis.\",\"HIV-1 infected and immune-activated macrophages and microglia secrete neurotoxins, such as tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1) and interleukin-1\\u03b2 (IL-1\\u03b2), which play major role in the neuronal death. It has been shown that different HIV-1 variants have varying abilities to elicit secretion of TNF-\\u03b1 by peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC); however, whether the difference of gp120 gene could affect the secretion of TNF-\\u03b1 and IL-1\\u03b2 by glial cells is unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the association between gene diversity and induction of neurotoxic cytokines. In this study, we constructed retroviral vectors MSCV-IRES-GFP/gp120 using HIV-1 gp120 genes isolated from four different tissues of one patient who died of AIDS dementia complex (ADC). Recombinant retroviruses produced by cotransfection of MSCV-IRES-GFP/gp120, pCMV-VSV-G and pUMVC into 293T cells were collected and added into U87 glial cells. Concentrations of TNF-\\u03b1 and IL-1\\u03b2 secreted by transduced U87 cells were assayed with ELISA separately. The four HIV-1 gp120 were in the different branch of the neighbor-joining tree. Compared to the pMIG retrovirus (gp120-negative) or U87 cells, all the gp120-positive recombinant retroviruses induced more TNF-\\u03b1 (P < 0.01) and IL-1\\u03b2 (P < 0.01). In addition, compared with the L/MIG retrovirus, all the three brain gp120-positive recombinant retroviruses induced less TNF-\\u03b1 (P < 0.01) and IL-1\\u03b2 (P < 0.01). HIV-1 gp120 could induce U87 cells secret more TNF-\\u03b1 and IL-1\\u03b2 again. The more important is that difference of HIV-1 gp120, especially cell-tropism may account for the different ability in eliciting secretion of TNF-\\u03b1 and IL-1\\u03b2, which might supply a novel idea helping understand the pathogenesis of ADC.\",\"CD4 T-cell decay is variable among HIV-infected individuals. In exceptional cases, CD4 T-cell counts remain stable despite high plasma viremia. HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) properties, namely tropism, fusion or the ability to induce the NK ligand NKp44L, or host factors that modulate Env cytopathic mechanisms may be modified in such situation. We identified untreated HIV-infected individuals showing non-cytopathic replication (VL>10,000 copies/mL and CD4 T-cell decay<50 cells/\\u00b5L/year, Viremic Non Progressors, VNP) or rapid progression (CD4 T-cells<350 cells/\\u00b5L within three years post-infection, RP). We isolated full-length Env clones and analyzed their functions (tropism, fusion activity and capacity to induce NKp44L expression on CD4 cells). Anti-Env humoral responses were also analyzed. Env clones isolated from VNP or RP individuals showed no major phenotypic differences. The percentage of functional clones was similar in both groups. All clones tested were CCR5-tropic and showed comparable expression and fusogenic activity. Moreover, no differences were observed in their capacity to induce NKp44L expression on CD4 T cells from healthy donors through the 3S epitope of gp41. In contrast, anti- Env antibodies showed clear functional differences: plasma from VNPs had significantly higher capacity than RPs to block NKp44L induction by autologous viruses. Consistently, CD4 T-cells isolated from VNPs showed undetectable NKp44L expression and specific antibodies against a variable region flanking the highly conserved 3S epitope were identified in plasma samples from these patients. Conversely, despite continuous antigen stimulation, VNPs were unable to mount a broad neutralizing response against HIV. Env functions (fusion and induction of NKp44L) were similar in viremic patients with slow or rapid progression to AIDS. However, differences in humoral responses against gp41 epitopes nearby 3S sequence may contribute to the lack of CD4 T cell decay in VNPs by blocking the induction of NKp44L by gp41.\",\"While human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 chemokine co-receptors 5 tropism and the GWGR motif in the envelope third variable region (V3 loop) have been associated with a slower disease progression, their influence on antiretroviral response remains unclear. The impact of baseline V3 characteristics on treatment response was evaluated in a randomised, double blind, prospective cohort study with patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir or efavirenz plus azithothymidine/3TC (1:1) over 48 weeks. Similar virological and immunological responses were observed for both treatment regimens. The 43 individuals had a mean baseline CD4 T cell count of 119 cells/mm(3) [standard deviation (SD) = 99] and a mean viral load of 5.09 log(10) copies/mL (SD = 0.49). The GWGR motif was not associated with a CD4 T cell response, but predicted R5 tropism by the geno2pheno([clinical20%]) algorithm correlated with higher CD4 T cell levels at all monitoring points (p < 0.05). Moreover, higher false-positive rates (FPR) values from this analysis revealed a strong correlation with CD4 T cell recovery (p < 0.0001). Transmitted drug resistance mutations, documented in 3/41 (7.3%) cases, were unrelated to the assigned antiretroviral regimen and had no impact on patient outcomes. In conclusion, na\\u00cfve HIV-1 R5 infected patients exhibited higher CD4 T cell counts at baseline; this difference was sustained throughout therapy. The geno2pheno([clinical]) option FPR positively correlated with CD4 T cell gain and may be useful in predicting CD4 T cell recovery.\",\"To investigate the value of tropism (determined by genotypic testing) to predict CD4 depletion in HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive patients with high CD4 counts. Viral tropism was determined by geno2pheno (false positive rate\\u200a=\\u200a10%) in 223 HIV-infected subjects naive to antiretrovirals with CD4 count \\u2265350 cells/\\u03bcL and HIV-RNA >500 copies/mL enrolled in the ICONA Foundation Study for whom a stored plasma sample (baseline) was retrospectively tested. We monitored CD4 cell count and identified predictors of decline before antiretroviral therapy initiation, applying a mixed linear model with covariates (age, gender, tropism, HIV risk factor, calendar year of HIV infection, months from HIV diagnosis to baseline, hepatitis C virus status, CD4 and HIV-RNA at sample collection and duration of follow-up). Two hundred and twenty-three subjects met the eligibility criteria; 137 (61%) were male and the median age was 35 (31-40) years. Median follow-up was 16.4 (3.2-37.2) months. Median CD4 decrease during follow-up was -157 (-278 to -13) cells/\\u03bcL. At baseline, 192 (86%) subjects were defined as harbouring R5 virus and 31 (14%) non-R5. Median CD4 count was 571 (458-729) cells/\\u03bcL and median HIV-RNA was 4.08 (3.57-4.55) log(10) copies/mL. At multivariable analysis, a greater mean CD4 decrease was associated with non-R5 viral tropism (-159.9 \\u00b1 12.22, P = 0.0002) at baseline. Other significant covariates were female gender, older age, intravenous drug use, longer duration of follow-up, and higher CD4 cell count and higher HIV-RNA at sample collection. In patients with CD4 counts \\u2265350 cells/\\u03bcL, non-R5 viral tropism by geno2pheno is predictive of CD4 decrease independent of their viral set point and CD4 counts.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects humans and chimpanzees but not old world monkeys (OWMs) such as the rhesus monkey (Rh) and cynomolgus monkey (CM). HIV-1 efficiently enters cells of OWMs but encounters a block before reverse transcription. This narrow host range is attributed to a barrier in the host cell. In 2004, the screening of a Rh cDNA library identified tripartite motif 5\\u03b1 (TRIM5\\u03b1) as a cellular antiviral factor. TRIM5\\u03b1 is one of splicing variants produced by TRIM5 gene and TRIM5 proteins are members of the TRIM family containing RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains. The RING domain is frequently found in E3 ubiquitin ligase and TRIM5\\u03b1 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. Among TRIM5 splicing variants, TRIM5\\u03b1 alone has an additional C-terminal PRYSPRY (B30.2) domain. Previous studies have shown that sequence variation in variable regions of the PRYSPRY domain among different monkey species affects species-specific retrovirus infection, while amino acid sequence differences in the viral capsid protein determine viral sensitivity to restriction. TRIM5\\u03b1 recognizes the multimerized capsid proteins (viral core) of an incoming virus by its PRYSPRY domain and is thus believed to control retroviral infection. There are significant intraspecies variations in the Rh-TRIM5 gene. It has also been reported that some Rh and CM individuals have retrotransposed cyclophilin A open reading frame in the TRIM5 gene, which produces TRIM5-cyclophilin A fusion protein (TRIMCyp). TRIMCyp, which was originally identified as an anti-HIV-1 factor of New World owl monkeys, is an interesting example of the gain of a new function by retrotransposition. As different TRIM5 genotypes of Rh showed different levels of simian immunodeficiency virus replication in vivo, the TRIM5 genotyping is thought to be important in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome monkey models.\",\"Maraviroc (MVC) has shown good efficacy and tolerability in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus. Data on patients switching to MVC while on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate patients on suppressive ART switching to an MVC-containing regimen (MVC-CR), and test the hypothesis that the switch may have an impact on T cell activation. The study population comprised 20 treated adults who started MVC with a plasma HIV-1-RNA load (viral load, VL) of <50 copies/ml. Viral tropism was assessed by V3 loop sequencing using proviral DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Changes in clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated at a median of 2 and 6 months of follow-up. T cell activation was determined by measuring soluble CD30 in plasma. Reasons for switching to a MVC-CR were drug toxicity and tolerability, low CD4 cell count and ART simplification. Over median 7.5 months of follow-up, 3/20 patients discontinued MVC due to severe headache, fatigue and VL rebound. A significant reduction in soluble CD30 levels in MVC-treated patients was observed during follow-up at both 2 (p = 0.027) and 6 months (p = 0.001). Switching suppressive ART to a MVC-CR based upon genotypic tropism prediction from proviral DNA improves tolerability. The observed impact on T cell activation warrants further investigation.\",\"An understanding of host cell factors that affect viral replication contributes to elucidation of the mechanism for determination of viral tropism. Cyclophilin A (CypA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), is a host factor essential for efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human cells. However, the role of cyclophilins in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication has not been determined. In the present study, we examined the effect of cyclosporine A (CsA), a PPIase inhibitor, on SIV replication. SIV replication in human CEM-SS T cells was not inhibited but rather enhanced by treatment with CsA, which inhibited HIV-1 replication. CsA treatment of target human cells enhanced an early step of SIV replication. CypA overexpression enhanced the early phase of HIV-1 but not SIV replication, while CypA knock-down resulted in suppression of HIV-1 but not SIV replication in CEM-SS cells, partially explaining different sensitivities of HIV-1 and SIV replication to CsA treatment. In contrast, CsA treatment inhibited SIV replication in macaque T cells; CsA treatment of either virus producer or target cells resulted in suppression of SIV replication. SIV infection was enhanced by CypA overexpression in macaque target cells. CsA treatment enhanced SIV replication in human T cells but abrogated SIV replication in macaque T cells, implying a host cell species-specific effect of CsA on SIV replication. Further analyses indicated a positive effect of CypA on SIV infection into macaque but not into human T cells. These results suggest possible contribution of CypA to the determination of SIV tropism.\",\"Genome sequences of transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 have been inferred by analyzing single genome amplicons of acute infection plasma viral RNA in the context of a mathematical model of random virus evolution; however, few of these T/F sequences have been molecularly cloned and biologically characterized. Here, we describe the derivation and biological analysis of ten infectious molecular clones, each representing a T/F genome responsible for productive HIV-1 clade B clinical infection. Each of the T/F viruses primarily utilized the CCR5 coreceptor for entry and replicated efficiently in primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes. This result supports the conclusion that single genome amplification-derived sequences from acute infection allow for the inference of T/F viral genomes that are consistently replication competent. Studies with monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) demonstrated various levels of replication among the T/F viruses. Although all T/F viruses replicated in MDM, the overall replication efficiency was significantly lower compared to prototypic \\\"highly macrophage-tropic\\\" virus strains. This phenotype was transferable by expressing the env genes in an isogenic proviral DNA backbone, indicating that T/F virus macrophage tropism mapped to Env. Furthermore, significantly higher concentrations of soluble CD4 were required to inhibit T/F virus infection compared to prototypic macrophage-tropic virus strains. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of clinical HIV-1 subtype B infection occurs by mucosal exposure to virus that is not highly macrophage tropic and that the generation and initial biological characterization of 10 clade B T/F infectious molecular clones provides new opportunities to probe virus-host interactions involved in HIV-1 transmission.\",\"Macrophages are important target cells for HIV-1 infection that play significant roles in the maintenance of viral reservoirs and other aspects of pathogenesis. Understanding the determinants of HIV-1 tropism for macrophages will inform HIV-1 control and eradication strategies. Tropism for macrophages is both qualitative (infection or not) and quantitative (replication capacity). For example many R5 HIV-1 isolates cannot infect macrophages, but for those that can the macrophage replication capacity can vary by up to 1000-fold. Some X4 viruses are also capable of replication in macrophages, indicating that cellular tropism is partially independent of co-receptor preference. Preliminary data obtained with a small number of transmitted/founder viruses indicate inefficient macrophage infection, whereas isolates from later in disease are more frequently tropic for macrophages. Thus tropism may evolve over time, and more macrophage tropic viruses may be implicated in the pathogenesis of advanced HIV-1 infection. Compartmentalization of macrophage-tropic brain-derived envelope glycoproteins (Envs), and non-macrophage tropic non-neural tissue-derived Envs points to adaptation of HIV-1 quasi-species in distinct tissue microenvironments. Mutations within and adjacent to the Env-CD4 binding site have been identified that determine macrophage tropism at the entry level, but post-entry molecular determinants of macrophage replication capacity involving HIV-1 accessory proteins need further definition.\",\"Maraviroc (MVC) is the first licensed antiretroviral drug from the class of coreceptor antagonists. It binds to the host coreceptor CCR5, which is used by the majority of HIV strains in order to infect the human immune cells (Fig. 1). Other HIV isolates use a different coreceptor, the CXCR4. Which receptor is used, is determined in the virus by the Env protein (Fig. 2). Depending on the coreceptor used, the viruses are classified as R5 or X4, respectively. MVC binds to the CCR5 receptor inhibiting the entry of R5 viruses into the target cell. During the course of disease, X4 viruses may emerge and outgrow the R5 viruses. Determination of coreceptor usage (also called tropism) is therefore mandatory prior to administration of MVC, as demanded by EMA and FDA. The studies for MVC efficiency MOTIVATE, MERIT and 1029 have been performed with the Trofile assay from Monogram, San Francisco, U.S.A. This is a high quality assay based on sophisticated recombinant tests. The acceptance for this test for daily routine is rather low outside of the U.S.A., since the European physicians rather tend to work with decentralized expert laboratories, which also provide concomitant resistance testing. These laboratories have undergone several quality assurance evaluations, the last one being presented in 2011. For several years now, we have performed tropism determinations based on sequence analysis from the HIV env-V3 gene region (V3). This region carries enough information to perform a reliable prediction. The genotypic determination of coreceptor usage presents advantages such as: shorter turnover time (equivalent to resistance testing), lower costs, possibility to adapt the results to the patients' needs and possibility of analysing clinical samples with very low or even undetectable viral load (VL), particularly since the number of samples analysed with VL < 1000 copies/\\u03bcl roughly increased in the last years (Fig. 3). The main steps for tropism testing (Fig. 4) demonstrated in this video: Collection of a blood sample Isolation of the HIV RNA from the plasma and/or HIV proviral DNA from blood mononuclear cells Amplification of the env region Amplification of the V3 region Sequence reaction of the V3 amplicon Purification of the sequencing samples Sequencing the purified samples Sequence editing Sequencing data interpretation and tropism prediction.\",\"The use of CCR5 inhibitors requires a tool to predict human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) tropism, as established in HIV-1. The aim of our study was to identify genotypic determinants of HIV-2 tropism located in the gp105 V3 loop. HIV-2 tropism phenotypic assays were performed on 53 HIV-2 clinical isolates using GFP expressing human osteosarcoma T4 [GHOST(3)] cell lines expressing CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors. The gp105 V3 loop was sequenced and analyzed. Thirty-four HIV-2 isolates were classified as R5, 7 as X4, and 12 as X4/R5 (dual). Substitution at residue 18 was always associated with a dual/X4 tropism (P < .00001). The following determinants were associated with dual/X4 tropism: a global net charge of more than +6 (P < .00001), V19K/R mutation (P < .00001), S22A/F/Y mutation (P < .002), Q23R mutation (P < .00001), and insertions at residue 24 (P < .00001), I25L/Y (P < .0004), R28K (P < .0004), and R30K (P < .014). These mutations were not found in R5 isolates, except R28K and R30K, which were detected in 4 and 5 R5 isolates, respectively. The 4 major genotypic determinants of dual/X4 tropism were mutation at residue 18, V19 K/R mutation, insertions at residue 24, and V3 global net charge. We established a strong association between HIV-2 phenotypic tropism and V3-loop sequences, allowing for the prediction of R5- and/or X4-tropic viruses in HIV-2 infection.\",\"Determination of human immunodeficiency virus tropism has contributed to the understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV and is necessary prior to the use of CCR5 antagonists. Replicate V3 sequences may generate different sequences and improve viral tropism prediction. The diversity of HIV was evaluated to access its influence on prediction. Plasma RNA was retro-transcribed and amplified using a one-step protocol, followed by nested PCR and sequencing using an ABI3130XL. Eighty-one patients, 74% male and 26% female, with a median age of 44 years had either a single sequence (n=50) or 2-4 replicates (n=31) evaluated. Most patients (92%) had used multiple anti-retroviral regimens. Tropism prediction was performed using the Geno2pheno clonal option. The number of ambiguous nucleotides, the deduced non-synonymous amino acids at V3 and the genetic distance were quantified. Using a 20% false positive rate (FPR) cut-off, 41/81 (50.6%) was predicted as X4. TCD4 was lower, 226 cells/mm(3) (IQR 82-378), in patients infected with X4; TCD4 for R5 was 324 cells/mm(3) (IQR 200-538, p<0.05). The number of ambiguous nucleotides correlated with a lower FPR value (p<0.0027). Although different sequences may be generated, the number of replicates was not associated to a lower FPR or X4 assignment, and may allow a better prediction of this biological characteristic. Ambiguous nucleotides correlate inversely to a lower FPR.\",\"The evaluation of new cases of HIV infection is relatively common in Spain, where several thousands of patients with new infections are diagnosed each year. Eighty per cent of them have a chronic HIV infection at the first clinical evaluation, which is symptomatic (late presenters) in up to 30% of patients. The initial evaluation of HIV infection is not only directed at determining the clinical, virological (plasma HIV RNA viral load, resistance test and viral tropism) and immunological (CD4+ T-cell cell count) situation of the patients, but must also address the study of their co-infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis) and comorbidities (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and bone) and the risk of HIV transmission. This is needed in order to decide, whether or not to start antiretroviral treatment, and with which combined antiretroviral treatment to start with, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, and the treatment of coinfections and comorbidities. The past and current medical history, the physical examination and laboratory tests will help us decide if the patient is to receive therapeutic intervention. The level of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes is the best marker to suggest when to start combined antiretroviral treatment, indicating whether or not to start prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (if patients have a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/mm(3)), and in advanced patients should make us suspect the presence of active opportunistic diseases in symptomatic cases. The management of patients with HIV infection must also include appropriate health education on the modes of transmission and prevention of HIV infection, and also to explain its natural history and how it can be modified with proper antiretroviral treatment, as well as to promote a healthy life. No less important is the psychological support, as these patients must learn to live with a chronic infection, which managed properly can ensure a very good long-term prognosis and quality of life.\",\"CCR5 antagonists inhibit HIV-1 entry by blocking the interaction of HIV-1 with the CCR5 cellular receptor. In patients with established HIV-1 infection, some viral strains use an alternative coreceptor for HIV-1 entry, CXCR4; CCR5 antagonists are not effective in patients harboring these viral strains. Coreceptor tropism testing of viral strains in an individual patient is necessary prior to treating with a CCR5 antagonist. There is one CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, that is FDA-approved for treatment of HIV-1 infection. This drug is used most commonly for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients who have failed other antiretroviral regimens. In addition to virologic effects, CCR5 antagonists are under investigation for immune-modulating effects and for HIV-1 prevention. Ongoing research will further elucidate the role of CCR5 antagonists in combating HIV disease.\",\"The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and persistence of syncytium-inducing (SI) strains in HIV-1-infected children along time of infection and to evaluate the influence of antiretroviral therapy and host factors on viral tropism. This is a retrospective analysis carried out in 267 HIV-1 vertically infected children from an Argentinean cohort. The viral phenotype was screened in MT-2 cells and coreceptor usage confirmed by the GHOST cell assay. Also, CD4(+) T cell count, viral load, antiretroviral therapy, and human CCR5-\\u039432 and CCR2-64I genotypes were analyzed. A high frequency of HIV-1 SI/CXCR4-using variants (22%) was found among children within the first trimester of life, reaching 46% after 10 years of infection. At acute infection, zidovudine prophylaxis did not significantly affect the proportions of SI HIV-1 strains, while their presence was favored by the CCR5(+)/\\u039432 genotype. Interestingly, the majority of the early SI strains did not persist over time, probably due to a higher susceptibility to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment or immunologic pressure. At the chronic stage, SI variants emerged even in the presence of HAART reaching 36% at 120 months of infection. Also the HIV-1 SI phenotype was associated with lower CD4(+) T cell counts all along the course of infection. These findings highlight the need to evaluate the presence of SI/CXCR4 variants early at primary infection. This will make it possible to optimize the use of CCR5 inhibitors in children who are apparently carriers of the R5 virus preventing early therapeutic failure due to the reemergence of SI strains from reservoirs.\",\"Genetic variability is a major feature of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and is considered the key factor frustrating efforts to halt the HIV epidemic. A proper understanding of HIV-1 genomic diversity is a fundamental prerequisite for proper epidemiology, genetic diagnosis, and successful drugs and vaccines design. Here, we report on the partial and near full-length genomic (NFLG) variability of HIV-1 isolates from a well-characterized cohort of recently infected patients in S\\u00e3o Paul, Brazil. HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 113 participants. The NFLG and partial fragments were determined by overlapping nested PCR and direct sequencing. The data were phylogenetically analyzed. Of the 113 samples (90.3% male; median age 31 years; 79.6% homosexual men) studied, 77 (68.1%) NFLGs and 32 (29.3%) partial fragments were successfully subtyped. Of the successfully subtyped sequences, 88 (80.7%) were subtype B sequences, 12 (11%) BF1 recombinants, 3 (2.8%) subtype C sequences, 2 (1.8%) BC recombinants and subclade F1 each, 1 (0.9%) CRF02 AG, and 1 (0.9%) CRF31 BC. Primary drug resistance mutations were observed in 14/101 (13.9%) of samples, with 5.9% being resistant to protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and 4.9% resistant to non-NRTIs. Predictions of viral tropism were determined for 86 individuals. X4 or X4 dual or mixed-tropic viruses (X4/DM) were seen in 26 (30.2%) of subjects. The proportion of X4 viruses in homosexuals was detected in 19/69 (27.5%). Our results confirm the existence of various HIV-1 subtypes circulating in S\\u00e3o Paulo, and indicate that subtype B account for the majority of infections. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance is relatively common among recently infected patients. The proportion of X4 viruses in homosexuals was significantly higher than the proportion seen in other study populations.\",\"Entry of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) into target cells is mediated by the CD4 receptor and a coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4. Maraviroc interferes with HIV entry by binding the CCR5 coreceptor. Virological failure to maraviroc-containing regimens can occur through the emergence of resistance, or through tropism evolution and broadened coreceptor usage. In the latter case, the physiological relevance of minority strains is a major concern. Here we report a retrospective analysis of coreceptor-usage and evolution based on 454-ultra-deep-sequencing of plasma and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC)-derived envelope V3-loops, accounting for coreceptor usage, from a patient who failed a maraviroc-containing regimen through the emergence of X4 strains. The X4 maraviroc-escape variant resulted from recombination between a long time archived proviral sequence from 2003 (5'-portion, including the V3-loop) and the dominant R5 strains circulating in plasma at the time of maraviroc-treatment initiation (3'-portion). Phylogenetic analyses and BEAST modeling highlighted that an early diverse viral quasispecies underwent a severe bottleneck following reinitiation of HAART and repeated IL-2 cycles between 1999 and 2001, leading to the transient outgrowth and archiving of one highly homogeneous X4 population from plasma, and to the expansion in plasma of one PBMC-derived R5 strain. Under maraviroc selective pressure, the early, no longer detectable X4 strains archived in PBMC were partially rescued to provide X4-determinants to the main circulating strain.\",\"To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of genotypic methods for predicting the co-receptor usage of subtypes B and non-B HIV-1 primary isolates, using as gold standard the infectivity of each primary isolate in GHOST cells stably expressing HIV-1 co-receptors. Primary isolates were obtained by co-culturing either patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or ultracentrifuged plasma with donor-activated PBMCs. In vitro co-receptor usage was determined by infecting GHOST cells. Tropism prediction, based on V3 sequences, was determined with simple rules and bioinformatic tools (Geno2pheno[coreceptor] and WebPSSM). This study includes 102 HIV-1 primary isolates; 23 (22.5%) subtype B and 79 (77.5%) non-B genetic forms. V3 sequences were classified into six subtypes (A-G), although 32 (31.4%) were circulating recombinant forms and 21 (20.6%) were unique recombinant forms. Sixty-nine isolates were R5, 27 R5X4 and 6 X4. The highest levels of sensitivity and specificity for the detection of X4 strains among V3 sequences, between 91% and 100%, were obtained by using PSSM(x4r5), PSSM(si/nsi) and the 11/25 rule for sequences of subtypes A, B and G, but not for subtype F. Establishing the recommended cut-off for clinical settings of a 10% false positive rate for Geno2pheno, we obtained 93% specificity and 97% sensitivity. Comparing genotypic assays for HIV-1 co-receptor use with a cell-culture phenotypic assay could provide more reliable results of sensitivity and specificity for the detection of X4 strains than comparing them with recombinant assays, considered as gold standard. In general, except for subtype F isolates, there is a good correlation for tropism prediction.\",\"Retroviruses are known to exhibit remarkable genomic pliancy, a capacity that has been attributed to one or more error prone steps in the viral replication cycle. However, increasing evidence suggests that such error represents a key element in viral survival, as exemplified by studies on virus immune evasion, shifts of cellular tropism, and anatomic compartmentalization, which facilitate persistent virus reservoirs. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of retroviral persistence is critical toward the goal of attaining HIV-1 eradication.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects macrophages effectively, despite relatively low levels of cell surface-expressed CD4. Although HIV-1 infections are defined by viral tropisms according to chemokine receptor usage (R5 and X4), variations in infection are common within both R5- and X4-tropic viruses, indicating additional factors may contribute to viral tropism. Using both solution and cell surface binding experiments, we showed that R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 gp120 proteins recognized a family of I-type lectin receptors, the Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglec). The recognition was through envelope-associated sialic acids that promoted viral adhesion to macrophages. The sialic acid-mediated viral-host interaction facilitated both R5-tropic pseudovirus and HIV-1(BaL) infection of macrophages. The high affinity Siglec-1 contributed the most to HIV-1 infection and the variation in Siglec-1 expression on primary macrophages from different donors was associated statistically with sialic acid-facilitated viral infection. Furthermore, envelope-associated sialoglycan variations on various strains of R5-tropic viruses also affected infection. Our study showed that sialic acids on the viral envelope facilitated HIV-1 infection of macrophages through interacting with Siglec receptors, and the expression of Siglec-1 correlated with viral sialic acid-mediated host attachment. This glycan-mediated viral adhesion underscores the importance of viral sialic acids in HIV infection and pathogenesis, and suggests a novel class of antiviral compounds targeting Siglec receptors.\",\"Genotypic prediction of HIV-1 tropism has been considered a practical surrogate for phenotypic tests and recently an European Consensus has set up recommendations for its use in clinical practice. Twenty-five antiretroviral-experienced patients, all heavily treated cases with a median of 16 years of antiretroviral therapy, had viral tropism determined by the Trofile assay and predicted by HIV-1 sequencing of partial env, followed by interpretation using web-based tools. Trofile determined 17/24 (71%) as X4 tropic or dual/mixed viruses, with one nonreportable result. The use of European consensus recommendations for single sequences (geno2pheno false-positive rates 20% cutoff) would lead to 4/24 (16.7%) misclassifications, whereas a composite algorithm misclassified 1/24 (4%). The use of the geno2pheno clinical option using CD4 T cell counts at collection was useful in resolving some discrepancies. Applying the European recommendations followed by additional web-based tools for cases around the recommended cutoff would resolve most misclassifications.\",\"Guidelines state that the CCR5-inhibitor Maraviroc should be prescribed to patients infected with R5-tropic HIV-1 only. Therefore, viral tropism needs to be assessed phenotypically or genotypically. Preliminary clinical trial data suggest that genotypic analysis in triplicate is associated with improved prediction of virological response by increasing the detection of X4-tropic variants. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of triplicate genotypic analysis on prediction of co-receptor usage in routine clinical practice. Samples from therapy-naive and therapy-experienced patients were collected for routine tropism testing at three European clinical centres. Viral RNA was isolated from plasma and proviral DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Gp120-V3 was amplified in a triplicate nested RT-PCR procedure and sequenced. Co-receptor usage was predicted using the Geno2Pheno([coreceptor]) algorithm and analysed with a false-positive rate (FPR) of 5.75%, 10%, or an FPR of 20% and according to the current European guidelines on the clinical management of HIV-1 tropism testing. A total of 266 sequences were obtained from 101 patient samples. Discordance in tropism prediction for the triplicates was observed in ten samples using an FPR of 10%. Triplicate testing resulted in a 16.7% increase in X4-predicted samples and to reclassification from R5 to X4 tropism for four cases rendering these patients ineligible for Maraviroc treatment. In conclusion, triplicate genotypic tropism testing increases X4 tropism detection in individual cases, which may prove to be pivotal when CCR5-inhibitor therapy is applied.\",\"The foreskin contains a subset of dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that may be targets for initial HIV infection in female-to-male sexual transmission of HIV-1. We present analyses comparing HIV-1 sequences isolated from foreskin DNA and serum RNA in 12 heterosexual men enrolled in an adult male circumcision trial performed in Rakai, Uganda. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated three topologies: (1) little divergence between foreskin and serum, (2) multiple genetic bottlenecks occurring in both foreskin and serum, and (3) complete separation of foreskin and serum populations. The latter tree topology provided evidence that foreskin may serve as a reservoir for distinct HIV-1 strains. Distance and recombination analysis also demonstrated that viral genotypes in the foreskin might segregate independently from the circulating pool of viruses.\",\"Rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) can pseudotype lentiviral vectors, although at a lower efficiency to that of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Transduction with VSVG-pseudotyped vectors of rodent central nervous system (CNS) leads to local neurotropic gene transfer, whereas with RVG-pseudotyped vectors additional disperse transduction of neurons located at distal efferent sites occurs via axonal retrograde transport. Attempts to produce high-titre RVG-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for preclinical and clinical trials has to date been problematic. We have constructed several chimeric RVG/VSVG glycoproteins and found that a construct bearing the external/transmembrane domain of RVG and the cytoplasmic domain of VSVG shows increased incorporation onto HIV-1 lentiviral particles and has increased infectivity in vitro in 293T cells and in differentiated neuronal cell lines of human, rat and murine origin. Stereotactic application of vector pseudotyped with this RVG/VSVG chimera in the rat striatum resulted in efficient gene transfer at the site of injection showing both neuronal and glial tropism. Distal neuronal transduction in the substantia nigra, thalamus and olfactory bulb via retrograde axonal transport also occurs after intrastriatal administration of chimera-pseudotyped vectors at similar levels to that observed with a RVG-pseudotyped vector. This is the first report of distal transduction in the olfactory bulb. The enhanced pseudotyping with this envelope should enable easier production of higher-titre pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that exhibit efficient local and dispersed neuronal transduction in the CNS.\",\"HIV-1 infections lead to a progressive depletion of CD4 cells culminating in AIDS. The coreceptor usage by HIV varies from CCR5 (R5) tropic early in infection to CXCR4 (X4) tropic in later infections. Although the coreceptor switch from R5 to X4 tropic HIV is well associated with progression to AIDS, the role of CCR5 in disease progression especially in patients infected exclusively with R5 isolates throughout the disease remains enigmatic. To better understand the role of CCR5 and R5 tropic HIV envelope in AIDS pathogenesis, we asked whether the levels of CCR5 and/or HIV Env-mediated fusion determine apoptosis of bystander cells. We generated CD4(+) T cell lines expressing varying levels of CCR5 on the cell surface to show that CCR5 expression levels correlate with bystander apoptosis induction. The mechanism of apoptosis involved caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial depolarization and was dependent on gp41 fusion activity as confirmed by fusion-restricted gp41 point mutants and use of the fusion inhibitor T20. Interestingly, lower levels of CCR5 were able to support virus replication in the absence of bystander apoptosis. Our findings suggest that R5 HIV-1-mediated bystander apoptosis is dependent on both CCR5 expression levels as well as fusogenic activity of the Env glycoprotein.\",\"Macrophage tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is distinct from coreceptor specificity of the viral envelope glycoproteins (Env), but the virus-cell interactions that contribute to efficient HIV-1 entry into macrophages, particularly via CXCR4, are not well understood. Here, we characterized a panel of HIV-1 Envs that use CCR5 (n = 14) or CXCR4 (n = 6) to enter monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) with various degrees of efficiency. Our results show that efficient CCR5-mediated MDM entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses is associated with increased tolerance of several mutations within the CCR5 N terminus. In contrast, efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry was associated with reduced tolerance of a large deletion within the CXCR4 N terminus. Env sequence analysis and structural modeling identified amino acid variants at positions 261 and 263 within the gp41-interactive region of gp120 and a variant at position 326 within the gp120 V3 loop that were associated with efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry. Mutagenesis studies showed that the gp41 interaction domain variants exert a significant but strain-specific influence on CXCR4-mediated MDM entry, suggesting that the structural integrity of the gp120-gp41 interface is important for efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry of certain HIV-1 strains. However, the presence of Ile326 in the gp120 V3 loop stem, which we show by molecular modeling is located at the gp120-coreceptor interface and predicted to interact with the CXCR4 N terminus, was found to be critical for efficient CXCR4-mediated MDM entry of divergent CXCR4-using Envs. Together, the results of our study provide novel insights into alternative mechanisms of Env-coreceptor engagement that are associated with efficient CCR5- and CXCR4-mediated HIV-1 entry into macrophages.\",\"The great majority of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains enter CD4+ target cells by interacting with one of two coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. Here we describe a transmitted/founder (T/F) virus (ZP6248) that was profoundly impaired in its ability to utilize CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors on multiple CD4+ cell lines as well as primary human CD4+ T cells and macrophages in vitro yet replicated to very high titers (>80 million RNA copies/ml) in an acutely infected individual. Interestingly, the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of this clade B virus had a rare GPEK sequence in the crown of its third variable loop (V3) rather than the consensus GPGR sequence. Extensive sequencing of sequential plasma samples showed that the GPEK sequence was present in virtually all Envs, including those from the earliest time points after infection. The molecularly cloned (single) T/F virus was able to replicate, albeit poorly, in cells obtained from ccr5\\u039432 homozygous donors. The ZP6248 T/F virus could also infect cell lines overexpressing the alternative coreceptors GPR15, APJ, and FPRL-1. A single mutation in the V3 crown sequence (GPEK->GPGK) of ZP6248 restored its infectivity in CCR5+ cells but reduced its ability to replicate in GPR15+ cells, indicating that the V3 crown motif played an important role in usage of this alternative coreceptor. These results suggest that the ZP6248 T/F virus established an acute in vivo infection by using coreceptor(s) other than CCR5 or CXCR4 or that the CCR5 coreceptor existed in an unusual conformation in this individual.\",\"Lentiviral vectors (LVs) derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are promising vehicles for gene delivery because they not only efficiently transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, but also maintain long-term transgene expression. Development of an LV system capable of transducing cells in a cell type-specific manner can be beneficial for certain applications that rely on targeted gene delivery. Previously it was shown that an inverse fusion strategy that incorporated an HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and its co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) onto vector surfaces could confer to LVs the ability to selectively deliver genes to HIV-1 envelope-expressing cells. To build upon this work, we aim to improve its relatively low transduction efficiency and circumvent its inability to target multiple tropisms of HIV-1 by a single vector. We investigated a method to create LVs co-enveloped with the HIV-1 cellular receptor CD4 and a fusogenic protein derived from the Sindbis virus glycoprotein and tested its efficiency to selectively deliver genes into cells expressing HIV-1 envelope proteins. The engineered LV system yields a higher level of transduction efficiency and a broader tropism towards cells displaying the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) than the previously developed system. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vitro that this engineered LV can preferentially deliver suicide gene therapy to HIV-1 envelope-expressing cells. We conclude that it is potentially feasible to target LVs towards HIV-1-infected cells by functional co-incorporation of the CD4 and fusogenic proteins, and provide preliminary evidence for further investigation on a potential alternative treatment for eradicating HIV-1-infected cells that produce drug-resistant viruses after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).\",\"Resistance mutations to the HIV-1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide emerge mainly within the drug's target region, HR1, and compensatory mutations have been described within HR2. The surrounding envelope (env) genetic context might also contribute to resistance, although to what extent and through which determinants remains elusive. To quantify the direct role of the env context in resistance to enfuvirtide and in viral infectivity, we compared enfuvirtide susceptibility and infectivity of recombinant viral pairs harboring the HR1-HR2 region or the full Env ectodomain of longitudinal env clones from 5 heavily treated patients failing enfuvirtide therapy. Prior to enfuvirtide treatment onset, no env carried known resistance mutations and full Env viruses were on average less susceptible than HR1-HR2 recombinants. All escape clones carried at least one of G36D, V38A, N42D and/or N43D/S in HR1, and accordingly, resistance increased 11- to 2800-fold relative to baseline. Resistance of full Env recombinant viruses was similar to resistance of their HR1-HR2 counterpart, indicating that HR1 and HR2 are the main contributors to resistance. Strictly X4 viruses were more resistant than strictly R5 viruses, while dual-tropic Envs featured similar resistance levels irrespective of the coreceptor expressed by the cell line used. Full Env recombinants from all patients gained infectivity under prolonged drug pressure; for HR1-HR2 viruses, infectivity remained steady for 3/5 patients, while for 2/5 patients, gains in infectivity paralleled those of the corresponding full Env recombinants, indicating that the env genetic context accounts mainly for infectivity adjustments. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that quasispecies selection is a step-wise process where selection of enfuvirtide resistance is a dominant factor early during therapy, while increased infectivity is the prominent driver under prolonged therapy.\",\"A change in coreceptor preference from CCR5 to CXCR4 towards the end stage disease in some HIV-1 infected individuals has been well documented, but the reasons and mechanisms for this tropism switch remain elusive. It has been suggested that envelope structural constraints in accommodating amino acid changes required for CXCR4 usage is an obstacle to tropism switch, limiting the rate and pathways available for HIV-1 coreceptor switching. The present study was initiated in two R5 SHIV(SF162P3N)-infected rapid progressor macaques with coreceptor switch to test the hypothesis that an early step in the evolution of tropism switch is the adoption of a less constrained and more \\\"open\\\" envelope conformation for better CD4 usage, allowing greater structural flexibility to accommodate further mutational changes that confer CXCR4 utilization. We show that, prior to the time of coreceptor switch, R5 viruses in both macaques evolved to become increasingly sCD4-sensitive, suggestive of enhanced exposure of the CD4 binding site and an \\\"open\\\" envelope conformation, and this correlated with better gp120 binding to CD4 and with more efficient infection of CD4(low) cells such as primary macrophages. Moreover, significant changes in neutralization sensitivity to agents and antibodies directed against functional domains of gp120 and gp41 were seen for R5 viruses close to the time of X4 emergence, consistent with global changes in envelope configuration and structural plasticity. These observations in a simian model of R5-to-X4 evolution provide a mechanistic basis for the HIV-1 coreceptor switch.\",\"Sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) across mucosal barriers is responsible for the vast majority of new infections. This relatively inefficient process results in the transmission of a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, from a diverse viral swarm in the donor, in approximately 80% of cases. Here we compared the biological activities of 24 clade B T/F envelopes (Envs) with those from 17 chronic controls to determine whether the genetic bottleneck that occurs during transmission is linked to a particular Env phenotype. To maximize the likelihood of an intact mucosal barrier in the recipients and to enhance the sensitivity of detecting phenotypic differences, only T/F Envs from individuals infected with a single T/F variant were selected. Using pseudotyping to assess Env function in single-round infectivity assays, we compared coreceptor tropism, CCR5 utilization efficiencies, primary CD4(+) T cell subset tropism, dendritic cell trans-infections, fusion kinetics, and neutralization sensitivities. T/F and chronic Envs were phenotypically equivalent in most assays; however, T/F Envs were modestly more sensitive to CD4 binding site antibodies b12 and VRC01, as well as pooled human HIV Ig. This finding was independently validated with a panel of 14 additional chronic HIV-1 Env controls. Moreover, the enhanced neutralization sensitivity was associated with more efficient binding of b12 and VRC01 to T/F Env trimers. These data suggest that there are subtle but significant structural differences between T/F and chronic clade B Envs that may have implications for HIV-1 transmission and the design of effective vaccines.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus displays a narrow tropism for CD4<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cells, and activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes are the main target. When these cells are depleted by viral replication, bystander apoptosis and increased cell turnover mediated by immune activation, there is a progressive immunodeficiency (i.e., AIDS). Despite this specific cell tropism, HIV-infected persons demonstrate pathology in nearly every organ system. This article reviews current understanding of tissue-specific HIV-1 infection in the CNS, the genital tract, and gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue.\",\"HIV infections are mainly acquired by mucosal transmission, through oral, rectal, or genital mucosa. Epithelial cells (EC) are the first cells encountered by HIV during infection through sexual transmission and breastfeeding. EC express several receptors critical for both primary HIV infection and secondary transmission. The regulation of co-receptor expression correlates with changes in susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 strains with different tropism. Moreover, inflammatory responses at mucosal surfaces after HIV-1 transmission may influence disease outcome. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of the accessory HIV-1 Nef protein on mucosal EC, using unstimulated or IFN-\\u03b3-stimulated HEp-2, T24, and Caco2\\u2009cell lines as models for homeostatic or inflamed mucosal tracts. We found that Nef significantly upregulated the expression of CXCR4 on the Caco-2\\u2009cell surface and the expression of galactosylceramide on the T24\\u2009cell surface. In addition, Nef significantly upregulated IL-6 production by T24 and Caco-2\\u2009cells, and TNF-\\u03b1 release by all three cell lines analyzed. Notably, Nef abrogated the IFN-\\u03b3-induced modulation of co-receptor expression and cytokine secretion. Our findings suggest that Nef differently regulates co-receptor expression and cytokine secretion at the epithelial level, depending on the anatomical derivation of the cells and the inflammatory status.\",\"Blocking HIV-1 cell entry has long been a major goal of anti-HIV drug development. Here, we report a successful design of two highly potent chimeric HIV entry inhibitors composed of one CCR5-targeting RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) variant (5P12-RANTES or 5P14-RANTES (Gaertner, H., Cerini, F., Escola, J. M., Kuenzi, G., Melotti, A., Offord, R., Rossitto-Borlat, I., Nedellec, R., Salkowitz, J., Gorochov, G., Mosier, D., and Hartley, O. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 17706-17711)) linked to a gp41 fusion inhibitor, C37. Chimeric inhibitors 5P12-linker-C37 and 5P14-linker-C37 showed extremely high antiviral potency in single cycle and replication-competent viral assays against R5-tropic viruses, with IC(50) values as low as 0.004 nm. This inhibition was somewhat strain-dependent and was up to 100-fold better than the RANTES variant alone or in combination with unlinked C37. The chimeric inhibitors also fully retained the antiviral activity of C37 against X4-tropic viruses, and this inhibition can be further enhanced significantly if the target cell co-expresses CCR5 receptor. On human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the inhibitors showed very strong inhibition against R5-tropic Ba-L strain and X4-tropic IIIB strain, with IC(50) values as low as 0.015 and 0.44 nm, which are 45- and 16-fold better than the parent inhibitors, respectively. A clear delivery mechanism requiring a covalent linkage between the two segments of the chimera was observed and characterized. Furthermore, the two chimeric inhibitors are fully recombinant and are easily produced at low cost. These attributes make them excellent candidates for anti-HIV microbicides. The results of this study also suggest a potent approach for optimizing existing HIV entry inhibitors or designing new inhibitors.\",\"Viral diversity and abundance are defining properties of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1's biology and pathogenicity. Despite the increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated dementia (HAD) continues to be a devastating consequence of HIV-1 infection of the brain although the underlying disease mechanisms remain uncertain. Herein, molecular diversity within the HIV-1 non-structural gene, Vpr, was examined in RNA sequences derived from brain and blood of HIV/AIDS patients with or without HIV-associated dementia (HAD) together with the ensuing pathobiological effects. Cloned brain- and blood-derived full length vpr alleles revealed that amino acid residue 77 within the brain-derived alleles distinguished HAD (77Q) from non-demented (ND) HIV/AIDS patients (77R) (p < 0.05) although vpr transcripts were more frequently detected in HAD brains (p < 0.05). Full length HIV-1 clones encoding the 77R-ND residue induced higher IFN-\\u03b1, MX1 and BST-2 transcript levels in human glia relative to the 77Q-HAD encoding virus (p < 0.05) but both viruses exhibited similar levels of gene expression and replication. Myeloid cells transfected with 77Q-(pVpr77Q-HAD), 77R (pVpr77R-ND) or Vpr null (pVpr(-))-containing vectors showed that the pVpr77R-ND vector induced higher levels of immune gene expression (p < 0.05) and increased neurotoxicity (p < 0.05). Vpr peptides (amino acids 70-96) containing the 77Q-HAD or 77R-ND motifs induced similar levels of cytosolic calcium activation when exposed to human neurons. Human glia exposed to the 77R-ND peptide activated higher transcript levels of IFN-\\u03b1, MX1, PRKRA and BST-2 relative to 77Q-HAD peptide (p < 0.05). The Vpr 77R-ND peptide was also more neurotoxic in a concentration-dependent manner when exposed to human neurons (p < 0.05). Stereotaxic implantation of full length Vpr, 77Q-HAD or 77R-ND peptides into the basal ganglia of mice revealed that full length Vpr and the 77R-ND peptide caused greater neurobehavioral deficits and neuronal injury compared with 77Q-HAD peptide-implanted animals (p < 0.05). These observations underscored the potent neuropathogenic properties of Vpr but also indicated viral diversity modulates innate neuroimmunity and neurodegeneration.\",\"Viral tropism influences the natural history of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) disease: X4 viruses are associated with faster decreases in CD4 cell count. There is scarce information about the influence of viral tropism on treatment outcomes. Baseline plasma samples from patients recruited to the ArTEN (Atazanavir/ritnoavir vs. Nevirapine on a background of Tenofovir and Emtricitabine) trial were retrospectively tested for HIV-1 tropism using the genotypic tool geno2pheno(FPR=5.75%). ArTEN compared nevirapine with atazanavir-ritonavir, both along with tenofovir-emtricitabine, in drug-na\\u00efve patients. Of 569 ArTEN patients, 428 completed 48 weeks of therapy; 282 of these received nevirapine and 146 of these received atazanavir-ritonavir. Overall, non-B subtypes of HIV-1 were recognized in 96 patients (22%) and X4 viruses were detected in 55 patients (14%). At baseline, patients with X4 viruses had higher plasma HIV RNA levels (5.4 vs 5.2 log copies/mL, respectively; P = .044) and lower CD4 cell counts (145 vs 188 cells/\\u03bcL, respectively; P < .001) than those with R5 strains. At week 48, virologic responses were lower in patients with X4 viruses than in patients with R5 viruses (77% vs 92%, respectively; P = .009). Multivariate analysis confirmed HIV-1 tropism as an independent predictor of virologic response at week 24 (P = .012). This association was extended to week 48 (P = .007) in clade B viruses. Conversely, CD4 cell count recovery was not influenced by baseline HIV-1 tropism. \\u2003HIV-1 tropism is an independent predictor of virologic response to first-line antiretroviral therapy. In contrast, it does not seem to influence CD4 cell count recovery. NCT00389207.\",\"Maraviroc belongs to the family of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonists that prevent the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into host CD4+ T cells by blocking the CCR5 co-receptor R5. Maraviroc is currently the only CC5R co-receptor inhibitor that has been approved for clinical use in HIV-1-infected patients carrying the CCR5 tropism who are antiretroviral-na\\u00efve or have experienced therapeutic failure following traditional antiretroviral therapies. This article is a review of the main characteristics of maraviroc and the latest data regarding its clinical application. Maraviroc is effective and well tolerated in pre-treated and antiretroviral-na\\u00efve patients with HIV-1 infections carrying the CCR5 tropism. Data from the phase III programme of maraviroc, which includes the MOTIVATE 1 and 2 studies and the MERIT study, indicate that maraviroc significantly (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) increases CD4+ cell counts compared with placebo in pre-treated patients and to a similar extent as efavirenz in antiretroviral-na\\u00efve patients. Even in cases where viral load is not completely suppressed, maraviroc improves immunological response compared with placebo. In addition, promising research suggests that maraviroc has favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in patients with high cardiovascular risk or those co-infected with tuberculosis or hepatitis and could be considered an option for treatment of HIV-infected patients with these co-morbidities. Resistance to maraviroc is low and mainly related to the presence of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) tropism HIV-1-infections or to mutations in the V3 region of glycoprotein (gp) 120; however, the exact mechanisms by which resistance is acquired and their genotypic and phenotypic pattern have not yet been established. It is recommended that a tropism test should be performed when considering maraviroc as an alternate drug in HIV-1-infected patients. Current tropism assays have increased sensitivity to reliably detect CXCR4 HIV with rapid turn-around and at a low cost. Improved detection together with positive data on the drug's efficacy and safety profiles should help physicians to identify more accurately the appropriate candidates for commencement of treatment with maraviroc. In summary, maraviroc improves immunological response and has shown favourable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in patients with high cardiovascular risk or in those co-infected with tuberculosis or hepatitis. Long-term studies are needed to confirm whether therapeutic expectations resulting from clinical trials with maraviroc translate into a real benefit for HIV-1-infected patients for whom traditional antiretroviral therapies have failed or are not suitable.\",\"We developed a sequencing assay for genotypic HIV-1 tropism determination. The assay allows examination of HIV RNA from plasma and HIV DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), including PBMC samples from patients with undetectable viral loads. Assessment of 100 pairs of plasma and PBMC samples showed a high concordance of 90%. With the limitations of population-based sequencing, the assay was found to be robust and suitable for the routine clinical laboratory.\",\"The third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 gp120 surface protein is a major determinant of cellular co-receptor binding. However, HIV-1 can also modulate its tropism through other regions in gp120, such as V1, V2 and C4 regions, as well as in the gp41 protein. Moreover, specific changes in gp41 are likely to be responsible for of damage in gp120-CCR5 interactions, resulting in potential resistance to CCR5 inhibitors.In order to genetically characterize the two envelope viral proteins in terms of co-receptor usage, we have analyzed 526 full-length env sequences derived from HIV-1 subtype-B infected individuals, from our and public (Los Alamos) databases. The co-receptor usage was predicted by the analysis of V3 sequences using Geno2Pheno (G2P) algorithm. The binomial correlation phi coefficient was used to assess covariation among gp120V3 and gp41 mutations; subsequently the average linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering was performed. According to G2P false positive rate (FPR) values, among 526 env-sequences analyzed, we further characterized 196 sequences: 105 with FPR <5% and 91 with FPR >70%, for X4-using and R5-using viruses, respectively.Beyond the classical signatures at 11/25 V3 positions (S11S and E25D, R5-tropic viruses; S11KR and E25KRQ, X4-tropic viruses), other specific V3 and gp41 mutations were found statistically associated with the co-receptor usage. Almost all of these specific gp41 positions are exposed on the surface of the glycoprotein. By the covariation analysis, we found several statistically significant associations between V3 and gp41 mutations, especially in the context of CXCR4 viruses. The topology of the dendrogram showed the existence of a cluster associated with R5-usage involving E25DV3, S11SV3, T22AV3, S129DQgp41 and A96Ngp41 signatures (bootstrap = 0.88). Conversely, a large cluster was found associated with X4-usage involving T8IV3, S11KRV3, F20IVYV3, G24EKRV3, E25KRV3, Q32KRV3, A30Tgp41, A189Sgp41, N195Kgp41 and L210Pgp41 mutations (bootstrap = 0.84). Our results show that gp120V3 and several specific amino acid changes in gp41 are associated together with CXCR4 and/or CCR5 usage. These findings implement previous observations that determinants of tropism may reside outside the V3-loop, even in the gp41. Further studies will be needed to confirm the degree to which these gp41 mutations contribute directly to co-receptor use.\",\"Maraviroc-containing regimens are known to achieve virological suppression in many treatment-experienced patients. This study aimed to evaluate a more rigorous methodological approach to resistance-response analysis in large clinical studies and to better establish which subpopulations of patients were most likely to benefit from maraviroc by refining and extending previous subgroup analyses from the MOTIVATE studies. Individual weighted optimized background therapy (OBT) susceptibility scores were calculated by combining genotypic or phenotypic resistance testing with prior drug use information. Virological response (HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48) using each of these methods was compared with a commonly used method of counting active drugs. Baseline predictors of virological response, including weighted or unweighted scoring, maraviroc use, baseline CD4(+) T-cell count, HIV-1 plasma viral load and tropism, were assessed by logistic regression modelling. Genotypic or phenotypic weighted methods were similarly predictive of virological response and better than counting active drugs. Weighted scoring and baseline CD4(+) T-cell count were the strongest predictors of virological response (P<0.0001): \\u224870% of maraviroc patients with a weighted score \\u22652 had a virological response, rising to \\u224880% when the baseline CD4(+) T-cell count was \\u226550 cells/mm(3). Approximately 80% of patients with a CD4(+) T-cell count \\u226550 cells/mm(3) receiving maraviroc with the equivalent of at least two fully active agents achieved HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml at week 48 in the MOTIVATE studies. Genotypic and phenotypic weighted scores were similarly predictive of virological response.\",\"HIV infections are initiated by a limited number of variants that diverge into a diverse quasispecies swarm. During in utero mother-to-child transmission (IU MTCT), transmitted viral variants must pass through multiple unique environments, and our previously published data suggest a nonstochastic model of transmission. As an alternative to a stochastic model of viral transmission, we hypothesize that viral selection in the placental environment influences the character of the viral quasispecies when HIV-1 is transmitted in utero. To test this hypothesis, we used single-template amplification to isolate HIV-1 envelope gene (env) sequences from both peripheral plasma and the placentas of eight nontransmitting (NT) and nine IU-transmitting participants. Statistically significant compartmentalization between peripheral and placental HIV-1 env was detected in one of the eight NT cases and six of the nine IU MTCT cases. In addition, viral sequences isolated from IU MTCT placental tissue showed variation in env V1 loop lengths compared to matched maternal sequences, while NT placental env sequences did not. Finally, comparison of env sequences from NT and IU MTCT participants indicated statistically significant differences in Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy in the signal peptide, C2, V3, and C3 regions. Our working hypothesis is that the hydropathy differences in Env associated with IU MTCT alter viral cellular tropism or affinity, allowing HIV-1 to efficiently infect placentally localized cells.\",\"The mechanism by which strictly CCR5 using HIV-1 clade C variants exacerbate disease progression in absence of coreceptor switch is not clearly known. We previously reported HIV-1 clade C envelopes (Env) obtained from late stage Indian patients with expanded coreceptor tropism. Here we compared such Envs (having expanded coreceptor tropism) with strictly CCR5 using Envs also obtained from late stage in their capacity to utilize CD4 and CCR5 for productive entry. We found that while envelopes with low CD4 dependence tend to infect primary CD4(+) T cells better than those required optimum CD4 for entry, no significant association was found between low CD4 usage and infectivity of primary CD4(+) T cells by Env-pseudotyped viruses and their sensitivity to CCR5 antagonist TAK-779. Interestingly, Envs that readily infected HeLa cells expressing low CD4 showed relative resistance to T20 indicating that conformational intermediates of these envelopes remained for a shorter period of time than is required for efficient inhibition by T20.\",\"Disease progression during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been associated with a switch of viral coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4. The current study investigates the effect of anti retroviral therapy (ART) on the viral tropism in a group of patients based on the V3 loop sequence, in ART na\\u00efve patients prior to and 24 weeks after ART. Genomic DNA was extracted from the PBMCs of these patients, and the C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env genes were cloned and sequenced. The coreceptor usage was predicated based on V3 loop amino acid sequences using Geno2pheno and PSSM programs. Our results indicate that following ART, the plasma viral loads of both CXCR4 and CCR5 viruses were significantly decreased. We observed a relatively higher ratio of R5 than X4 virus after 24 weeks of ART and both the positive charges and the net charges of the V3 regions were decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after ART. We conclude that ART significantly, reduced both X4 and R5 viruses with a preferential suppression of X4 virus. These data will help improve prognostic outcomes and help clinicians determine the course of treatment in patients who exhibit virologic failure while taking a CCR5 antagonist.\",\"HIV-1 circulates within an infected host as a genetically heterogeneous viral population. Viral intrahost diversity is shaped by substitutional evolution and recombination. Although many studies have speculated that recombination could have a significant impact on viral phenotype, this has never been definitively demonstrated. We report here phylogenetic and subsequent phenotypic analyses of envelope genes obtained from HIV-1 populations present in different anatomical compartments. Assessment of env compartmentalization from immunologically discrete tissues was assessed utilizing a single genome amplification approach, minimizing in vitro-generated artifacts. Genetic compartmentalization of variants was frequently observed. In addition, multiple incidences of intercompartment recombination, presumably facilitated by low-level migration of virus or infected cells between different anatomic sites and coinfection of susceptible cells by genetically divergent strains, were identified. These analyses demonstrate that intercompartment recombination is a fundamental evolutionary mechanism that helps to shape HIV-1 env intrahost diversity in natural infection. Analysis of the phenotypic consequences of these recombination events showed that genetic compartmentalization often correlates with phenotypic compartmentalization and that intercompartment recombination results in phenotype modulation. This represents definitive proof that recombination can generate novel combinations of phenotypic traits which differ subtly from those of parental strains, an important phenomenon that may have an impact on antiviral therapy and contribute to HIV-1 persistence in vivo.\",\"Bacitracin and the membrane-impermeant thiol reagent 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) are agents known to inhibit protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a cell-surface protein critical in HIV-1 entry therefore they are fusion inhibitors (FI). Here we investigated the possibility that Bacitracin and or DTNB might have other antiviral activities besides FI. By means of residual activity assays, we found that both compounds showed antiviral activity only to viruses T-tropic HIV-1 strain. Cell-based fusion assays showed inhibition on HeLa-CD4-LTR-\\u03b2-gal (CD4) and HL2/3 cells treated with Bacitracin, and DTNB with the latest compound we observed fusion inhibition on both cells but strikingly in HL2/3 cells (expressing Env) indicating a possible activity on both, the cell membrane and the viral envelope. A time-of-addition experiment showed that both compounds act on HIV entry inhibition but DTNB also acts at late stages of the viral cycle. Lastly, we also found evidence of long-lasting host cell protection in vitro by DTNB, an important pharmacodynamic parameter for a topical microbicide against virus infection, hours after the extracellular drug was removed; this protection was not rendered by Bacitracin. These drugs proved to be leading compounds for further studies against HIV showing antiviral characteristics of interest.\",\"Viral tropism is the ability of viruses to enter and infect specific host cells and is based on the ability of viruses to bind to receptors on those cells. Testing for HIV tropism is recommended before prescribing a chemokine receptor blocker. In most European countries, HIV tropism is identified with tropism phenotype testing. New data support genotype analysis of the HIV third hypervariable loop (V3) for the identification of tropism. The European Consensus Group on clinical management of tropism testing was established to make recommendations to clinicians and clinical virologists. The panel recommends HIV-tropism testing for the following groups: drug-naive patients in whom toxic effects are anticipated or for whom few treatment options are available; patients who have poor tolerability to or toxic effects from current treatment or who have CNS pathology; and patients for whom therapy has failed and a change in treatment is considered. In general, an enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay and V3 population genotyping are the recommended methods. Genotypic methods are anticipated to be used more frequently in the clinical setting because of their greater accessibility, lower cost, and faster turnaround time than other methods. For the interpretation of V3 loop genotyping, clinically validated systems should be used when possible. Laboratories doing HIV tropism tests should have adequate quality assurance measures. Similarly, close collaboration between HIV clinicians and virologists is needed to ensure adequate diagnostic and treatment decisions.\",\"HIV infection is characterized by gradual immune system collapse and hematopoietic dysfunction. We recently showed that HIV enters multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells and establishes both active cytotoxic and latent infections that can be reactivated by myeloid differentiation. However, whether these multipotent progenitors include long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that could establish viral reservoirs for the life of the infected person remains unknown. Here we provide direct evidence that HIV targets long-lived HSCs and show that infected HSCs yield stable, multilineage engraftment in a xenograft model. Furthermore, we establish that the capacity to use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 for entry determines whether a virus will enter multipotent versus differentiated progenitor cells. Because HSCs live for the life span of the infected person and are crucial for hematopoietic health, these data may explain the poor prognosis associated with CXCR4-tropic HIV infection and suggest HSCs as long-lived cellular reservoirs of latent HIV.\",\"Maraviroc is the first licensed chemokine co-receptor 5 (CCR5) co-receptor antagonist in clinical practice. It is currently being used in patients harbouring exclusively CCR5-tropic virus. The objective of the study was to investigate the impact of maraviroc on viruses with different co-receptor preferences in a patient with a dual/mixed (D/M) infection. We present a case report of an HIV-1 patient infected with a D/M virus population. Co-receptor tropism was determined by phenotypic and genotypic tests. Biological clones from pre- and post-maraviroc therapy were generated. Tropism of these infectious clones was investigated in U373-MAGI cells expressing CD4+\\u200aCCR5+ or CD4+\\u200aCXCR4+. Maraviroc susceptibility and viral replication were determined using donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In-depth clonal genotypic analysis revealed the presence of both R5-tropic variants and X4-tropic viruses before the start of maraviroc. During maraviroc therapy all R5-predicted viruses were suppressed. Phenotypic analyses revealed that all biological clones before maraviroc therapy could infect both CCR5- and CXCR4-bearing U373-MAGI cells, demonstrating dual tropism. The baseline biological clones preferentially infected the CCR5 cell line and were fully susceptible to maraviroc in PBMCs (dual-R5). In contrast, during maraviroc therapy the dual-R5-tropic viruses were replaced by more X4-tropic viruses (dual-X4), which could not be inhibited by maraviroc. This case report demonstrates that dual-tropic viruses, capable of using both co-receptors in phenotypic assays, can be inhibited by maraviroc if they have a CCR5 co-receptor preference in vivo.\",\"A survey of HIV coreceptor usage in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and plasma samples from na\\u00efve seropositive patients was conducted. One hundred patients were enrolled in this study. Of the 100 patients, 36 had a primary or recent infection (P-RI), 31 had an early chronic infection (>350 CD4 cells) (ECI), and 33 had a late chronic infection (LCI). All 3 compartments were sampled in a subset of 33 participants, while the remaining 67 patients provided plasma samples and PBMCs only. Seventy-seven patients harbored the R5 virus in plasma samples and had a significantly higher median and percentage of CD4(+) T cells than patients with X4 virus (437 and 281 cells/\\u03bcl, respectively; P = 0.0086; 20.6% and 18.6%, respectively). The X4 strain was detected more frequently in patients with LCI than in patients with P-RI or ECI (39.3%, 19.4%, and 9.6%, respectively; P = 0.0063). PBMC and plasma tropism was concordant in 90 patients, and 73 had the R5 strain. Among patients with discordant results, 4 had the R5 virus in their plasma and the X4 virus in PBMCs; 6 showed the opposite profile. Plasma, PBMC, and CSF tropism determinations were concordant in 26/33 patients (21 patients had R5, and 5 had X4). The tropism was discordant in 5/33 patients, with the X4 virus in plasma and R5 in CSF; the HIV tropism in PBMCs was X4 in 3 patients. The remaining 2/33 patients had the R5 virus in plasma and PBMCs and the X4 virus in CSF; one of these patients had a P-RI. The discordant tropism in CSF and blood may have implications for chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist use in patients with limited response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) or in responding patients evaluated for simplification of treatment.\",\"Dual/mixed-tropic HIV-1 strains are predominant in a significative proportion of patients, though few information is available regarding the genetic characteristics, quasispecies composition, and susceptibility against CCR5-antagonists of the primary-isolates. For this reason, we investigated in deep details, both phenotypically and genotypically, the characteristics of 54 HIV-1 primary-isolates obtained from HIV-infected patients. Tropism was assessed by multiple-cycles phenotypic-assay on U87MG-CD4(+)-CCR5(+)-/CXCR4(+)-expressing cells. In vitro selection in PBMCs of X4-tropic viral strains following maraviroc-treatment was also performed. Phenotypic-assay reported pure R5-tropic viruses in 31 (57.4%) isolates, dual/mixed-tropic viruses in 22 (40.7%), and pure X4-tropic virus in only 1 (1.8%). Among dual/mixed-tropic isolates, 12 showed a remarkably higher replication-efficacy in CCR5-expressing cells (R5(+)/X4), and 2 in CXCR4-expressing cells (R5/X4(+)). Genotypic-tropism testing showed a correlation between PSSM-scores, geno2pheno false-positive-rate, and V3-net-charge with both CCR5-usage and syncytium-inducing ability. Moreover, specific gp120- and gp41-mutations were significantly associated with tropism and/or syncytium-inducing ability. Ultra-deep V3-pyrosequencing showed the presence of a swarm of genetically distinct species with a preference for CCR5-coreceptor not only in all pure R5-isolates, but also in 6/7 R5(+)/X4-tropic isolates. In both pure-X4 and R5/X4(+)-isolates, we observed extensive prevalence of X4-using species. In vitro selection-experiments with CCR5-inhibitor maraviroc (up to 2 months) showed no-emergence of X4-tropic variants for all R5- and R5(+)/X4-isolates tested (while X4-virus remained fully-resistant). In conclusion, our study shows that dual/mixed-tropic viruses are constituted by different species, whereby those with characteristics R5(+)/X4 are genotypically and phenotypically similar to the pure-R5 isolates; thus the use of CCR5-antagonists in patients with R5(+)/X4-tropic viruses may be a therapeutic-option that deserves further investigations.\",\"As the initial barrier to viral entry, the plasma membrane along with the membrane trafficking machinery and cytoskeleton are of fundamental importance in the viral cycle. However, little is known about the contribution of plasma membrane dynamics during early human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Considering that ADP ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) regulates cellular invasion via several microorganisms by coordinating membrane trafficking, our aim was to study the function of Arf6-mediated membrane dynamics on HIV-1 entry and infection of T lymphocytes. We observed that an alteration of the Arf6-guanosine 5'-diphosphate/guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP/GDP) cycle, by GDP-bound or GTP-bound inactive mutants or by specific Arf6 silencing, inhibited HIV-1 envelope-induced membrane fusion, entry, and infection of T lymphocytes and permissive cells, regardless of viral tropism. Furthermore, cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission of primary human CD4(+) T lymphocytes was inhibited by Arf6 knockdown. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed that Arf6 mutants provoked the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-biphosphate-associated structures on the plasma membrane of permissive cells, without affecting CD4-viral attachment but impeding CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry. Arf6 silencing or its mutants did not affect fusion, entry, and infection of vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped viruses or ligand-induced CXCR4 or CCR5 endocytosis, both clathrin-dependent processes. Therefore we propose that efficient early HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) T lymphocytes requires Arf6-coordinated plasma membrane dynamics that promote viral fusion and entry.\",\"Maraviroc (MVC) inhibits the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by binding to and modifying the conformation of the CCR5 extracellular loops (ECLs). Resistance to MVC results from alterations in the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoproteins (Env) enabling recognition of the drug-bound conformation of CCR5. To better understand the mechanisms underlying MVC resistance, we characterized the virus-cell interactions of gp120 from in vitro-generated MVC-resistant HIV-1 (MVC-Res Env), comparing them with those of gp120 from the sensitive parental virus (MVC-Sens Env). In the absence of the drug, MVC-Res Env maintains a highly efficient interaction with CCR5, similar to that of MVC-Sens Env, and displays a relatively modest increase in dependence on the CCR5 N terminus. However, in the presence of the drug, MVC-Res Env interacts much less efficiently with CCR5 and becomes critically dependent on the CCR5 N terminus and on positively charged elements of the drug-modified CCR5 ECL1 and ECL2 regions (His88 and His181, respectively). Structural analysis suggests that the Val323 resistance mutation in the gp120 V3 loop alters the secondary structure of the V3 loop and the buried surface area of the V3 loop-CCR5 N terminus interface. This altered mechanism of gp120-CCR5 engagement dramatically attenuates the entry of HIV-1 into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), cell-cell fusion activity in MDM, and viral replication capacity in MDM. In addition to confirming that HIV-1 escapes MVC by becoming heavily dependent on the CCR5 N terminus, our results reveal novel interactions with the drug-modified ECLs that are critical for the utilization of CCR5 by MVC-Res Env and provide additional insights into virus-cell interactions that modulate macrophage tropism.\",\"Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) provides a source of mucosal CD4(+) T cells. We investigated the physiological properties of T lymphocytes from BALF and blood and their role on the dynamic of HIV-1 replication among AIDS patients with active lung infections. Pulmonary CD4(+) T cells consist mainly of effector memory cells (CD45RO(+) and CCR7(-)) with increased expression of activation markers (HLA-DR(+) and CD69(+)) when compared to the blood counterpart. We observed a high frequency of BALF cells capable of secreting HIV-1-Ags suggesting that the local lung environment may support favorable conditions for CD4(+) T lymphocytes harboring HIV-1 DNA to initiate the viral cycle. Nevertheless, the high number of IFN-\\u03b3-producing cells and the predominance of Th1 immune response in the lung could limit the secretion of HIV-1 RNA. In conclusion, the capacity of activated CD4(+) T cells to produce HIV-1 is driven by both the level and quality of cellular activation in the lung.\",\"The relevance of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection of macaques to HIV-1 infection in humans depends on how closely SHIVs mimic HIV-1 transmission, pathogenesis, and diversity. Circulating HIV-1 strains are predominantly subtypes C and A and overwhelmingly require CCR5 for entry, yet most SHIVs incorporate CXCR4-using subtype B envelopes (Envs). While pathogenic subtype C-based SHIVs have been constructed, the subtype A-based SHIVs (SHIV-As) constructed to date have been unable to replicate in macaque cells. To understand the barriers to SHIV-A replication in macaque cells, HIVA(Q23)/SIV(vif) was constructed by engineering a CCR5-tropic subtype A provirus to express SIV vif, which counters the macaque APOBEC3G restriction. HIVA(Q23)/SIV(vif) replicated poorly in pig-tailed macaque (Ptm) lymphocytes, but viruses were adapted to Ptm lymphocytes. Two independent mutations in gp120, G312V (V3 loop) and A204E (C2 region), were identified that increased peak virus levels by >100-fold. Introduction of G312V and A204E to multiple subtype A Envs and substitution of G312 and A204 with other residues increased entry into Ptm cells by 10- to 100-fold. G312V and A204E Env variants continued to require CCR5 for entry but were up to 50- and 200-fold more sensitive to neutralization by IgG1b12 and soluble CD4 and had a 5- to 50-fold increase in their ability to utilize Ptm CD4 compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings identify the inefficient use of Ptm CD4 as an unappreciated restriction to subtype A HIV-1 replication in Ptm cells and reveal amino acid changes to gp120 that can overcome this barrier.\",\"CXCR4-tropic viruses have been associated with advanced immune suppression. However, 50% of patients with AIDS exclusively harbor CCR5-tropic viruses. The net charge at HIV-1 envelope gp120 variable regions was examined in 66 HIV-1-infected individuals with CCR5-tropic viruses, of whom 30 had less than 200 cells/mm(3). A positive net charge at gp120 variable regions was significantly associated with lower CD4 counts. Thus, the net charge at gp120 variable regions could influence HIV-1 disease progression in subjects with CCR5-tropic viruses.\",\"Among Old World monkeys, pig-tailed macaques (Pt) are uniquely susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), although the infection does not persist. We demonstrate that the susceptibility of Pt T cells to HIV-1 infection is due to the absence of postentry inhibition by a TRIM5 isoform. Notably, substitution of the viral infectivity factor protein, Vif, with that from pathogenic SIVmne enabled replication of HIV-1 in Pt T cells in vitro. When inoculated into juvenile pig-tailed macaques, the Pt-tropic HIV-1 persistently replicated for more than 1.5 to 2 years, producing low but measurable plasma viral loads and persistent proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It also elicited strong antibody responses. However, there was no decline in CD4(+) T cells or evidence of disease. Surprisingly, the Pt-tropic HIV-1 was rapidly controlled when inoculated into newborn Pt macaques, although it transiently rebounded after 6 months. We identified two notable differences between the Pt-tropic HIV-1 and SIVmne. First, SIV Vif does not associate with Pt-tropic HIV-1 viral particles. Second, while Pt-tropic HIV-1 degrades both Pt APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, it prevents their inclusion in virions to a lesser extent than pathogenic SIVmne. Thus, while SIV Vif is necessary for persistent infection by Pt-tropic HIV-1, improved expression and inhibition of APOBEC3 proteins may be required for robust viral replication in vivo. Additional adaptation of the virus may also be necessary to enhance viral replication. Nevertheless, our data suggest the potential for the pig-tailed macaque to be developed as an animal model of HIV-1 infection and disease.\",\"Prior to receiving a drug from CCR5-antagonist class in HIV therapy, a patient must undergo an HIV tropism test to confirm that his or her viral population uses the CCR5 coreceptor for cellular entry, and not an alternative coreceptor. One approach to tropism testing is to examine the sequence of the V3 region of the HIV envelope, which interacts with the coreceptor. Viral RNA is extracted from blood plasma. The V3 region is amplified in triplicate with nested reverse transcriptase-PCR. The amplifications are then sequenced and analyzed using the software, RE_Call. Sequences are then submitted to a bioinformatic algorithm such as geno2pheno to infer viral tropism from the V3 region. Sequences are inferred to be non-R5 if their geno2pheno false positive rate falls below 5.75%. If any one of the three sequences from a sample is inferred to be non-R5, the patient is unlikely to respond to a CCR5-antagonist.\",\"Subtype G has been estimated to represent the fourth most prevalent clade in the HIV-1 pandemic and subtype F is widely circulating in parts of South America (frequently within BF recombinant forms) and in Romania. However, functional envelope clones of these subtypes are lacking, which are needed for studies on antibody-mediated neutralization, coreceptor usage, and efficiency of viral entry inhibitor drugs. Here we report the construction, neutralization properties, and coreceptor usage of HIV-1 functional envelope clones of subtypes G (n = 15) and F (n = 7). These clones were obtained through RT-PCR amplification of HIV-1 gp160 from plasma RNA, and were used for pseudovirus production. All 15 subtype G-enveloped pseudoviruses were resistant to neutralization by gp120-targeted broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) b12 and 2G12, while a majority were neutralized by gp41-targeted MAbs 2F5 and 4E10. With regard to the subtype F envelopes, all seven pseudoviruses were resistant to 2F5 and b12, six were resistant to G12, and six were neutralized by 4E10. Coreceptor usage testing revealed that 21 of 22 envelopes were CCR5-tropic, including all 15 subtype G envelopes, seven of which were from patients with CD4(+) T cell counts <200/ml. These results confirm the broadly neutralizing activity of 4E10 on envelope clones across all tested group M clades, including subtypes G and F, reveal the resistance of most subtype F-enveloped pseudoviruses to broadly neutralizing MAbs b12, 2G12, and 2F5, and suggest that, similarly to subtype C, CXCR4 tropism is uncommon in subtype G, even at advanced stages of infection.\",\"NaN\",\"The major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, mediate virus entry into CD4+ cells and are therefore a critical component of the HIV-1 life cycle. Alterations in coreceptor preference as well as the efficiency and mechanism of interaction between HIV-1 and CCR5 and/or CXCR4 has a significant influence on viral tropism, progression of disease, and response to coreceptor antagonists. In addition, these alterations influence the susceptibility of CD4+ T-cell, monocyte, and dendritic cell subsets to infection and therefore, are important for several facets of HIV-1 pathogenesis including the establishment of latent reservoirs, trafficking, and transmission. This review highlights recent literature that has advanced our understanding of the role of coreceptors in HIV-1 pathogenesis.\",\"The tropism of retroviruses relies on their ability to exploit cellular factors for their replication as well as to avoid host-encoded inhibitory activities such as TRIM5\\u03b1. N-tropic murine leukemia virus is sensitive to human TRIM5\\u03b1 (huTRIM5\\u03b1) restriction, whereas human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) escapes this antiviral factor. We previously revealed that mutation of four critical amino acid residues within the capsid can render murine leukemia virus resistant to huTRIM5\\u03b1. Here, we exploit the high degree of conservation in the tertiary structure of retroviral capsids to map the corresponding positions on the HIV1 capsid. We then demonstrated that, when changes were introduced at some of these positions, HIV1 becomes sensitive to huTRIM5\\u03b1 restriction, a phenomenon reinforced by additionally mutating the nearby cyclophilin A binding loop of the viral protein. These results indicate that retroviruses have evolved similar mechanisms to escape TRIM5\\u03b1 restriction via the interference of structurally homologous determinants in the viral capsid.\",\"The CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the HIV-1 envelope plays a major role in determining the capacity of R5 viruses to infect primary macrophages. Thus, envelope determinants within or proximal to the CD4bs have been shown to control the use of low CD4 levels on macrophages for infection. These residues affect the affinity for CD4 either directly or indirectly by altering the exposure of CD4 contact residues. Here, we describe a single amino acid determinant in the V1 loop that also modulates macrophage tropism. Thus, we identified an E153G substitution that conferred high levels of macrophage infectivity for several heterologous R5 envelopes, while the reciprocal G153E substitution abrogated infection. Shifts in macrophage tropism were associated with dramatic shifts in sensitivity to the V3 loop monoclonal antibody (MAb), 447-52D and soluble CD4, as well as more modest changes in sensitivity to the CD4bs MAb, b12. These observations are consistent with an altered conformation or exposure of the V3 loop that enables the envelope to use low CD4 levels for infection. The modest shifts in b12 sensitivity suggest that residue 153 impacts on the exposure of the CD4bs. However, the more intense shifts in sCD4 sensitivity suggest additional mechanisms that likely include an increased ability of the envelope to undergo conformational changes following binding to suboptimal levels of cell surface CD4. In summary, we show that a conserved determinant in the V1 loop modulates the V3 loop to prime low CD4 use and macrophage infection.\",\"The binding of murine IgM mAbs to five different clades of HIV-1 was examined using a modified ELISA-based virus capture assay. Two murine multispecific IgM mAbs that exhibit both lipid and gp41 epitope specificities, and one murine IgM mAb that exhibits lipid-binding specificity, were utilized. The binding of the IgG and the IgM isotypes of human mAb 2F5 to clades A through AE were also evaluated. The binding of 2F5 to HIV-1 was dependent upon the antibody isotype. Monoclonal IgM antibodies bound significantly lower amounts of HIV-1 than the corresponding IgG isotype. Although murine IgM mAbs bound HIV-1 to varying degrees in the virus capture assay, they failed to neutralize HIV-1 in a TZM-bl pseudovirus assay. In contrast, 2F5-IgM mAb bound certain HIV-1 isolates, and also neutralized them, although not as efficiently as the 2F5-IgG isotype. Studies on the relationship between virus binding and neutralization in a TZM-bl pseudovirus assay indicated that in most cases, mAbs that exhibited neutralization also bound the virus.\",\"One proposed HIV vaccine strategy is to induce Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses that can corner the virus, through fitness cost of viral escape and unavailability of compensatory mutations. We show here that the most variable capsid residues principally comprise escape mutants driven by protective alleles HLA-B*57, -5801, and -8101 and covarying HLA-independent polymorphisms that arise in conjunction with these escape mutations. These covarying polymorphisms are potentially compensatory and are concentrated around three tropism-determining loops of p24, suggesting structural interdependencies. Our results demonstrate complex patterns of adaptation of HIV under immune selection pressure, the understanding of which should aid vaccine design.\",\"Host determinants of HIV-1 viral tropism include factors from producer cells that affect the efficiency of productive infection and factors in target cells that block infection after viral entry. TRIM5\\u03b1 restricts HIV-1 infection at an early post-entry step through a mechanism associated with rapid disassembly of the retroviral capsid. Topoisomerase I (TOP1) appears to play a role in HIV-1 viral tropism by incorporating into or otherwise modulating virions affecting the efficiency of a post-entry step, as the expression of human TOP1 in African Green Monkey (AGM) virion-producing cells increased the infectivity of progeny virions by five-fold. This infectivity enhancement required human TOP1 residues 236 and 237 as their replacement with the AGM counterpart residues abolished the infectivity enhancement. Our previous studies showed that TOP1 interacts with BTBD1 and BTBD2, two proteins which co-localize with the TRIM5\\u03b1 splice variant TRIM5\\u03b4 in cytoplasmic bodies. Because BTBD1 and BTBD2 interact with one HIV-1 viral tropism factor, TOP1, and co-localize with a splice variant of another, we investigated the potential involvement of BTBD1 and BTBD2 in HIV-1 restriction. We show that the interaction of BTBD1 and BTBD2 with TOP1 requires hu-TOP1 residues 236 and 237, the same residues required to enhance the infectivity of progeny virions when hu-TOP1 is expressed in AGM producer cells. Additionally, interference with the expression of BTBD2 in AGM and human 293T target cells increased their permissiveness to HIV-1 infection two- to three-fold. These results do not exclude the possibility that BTBD2 may modestly restrict HIV-1 infection via colocation with TRIM5 variants in cytoplasmic bodies.\",\"The aim of this study was to investigate HIV-1 molecular diversity and the epidemiological profile of HIV-1-infected patients from Ribeir\\u00e3o Preto, Brazil. A nested PCR followed by sequencing of a 302-base pair fragment of the env gene (C2-V3 region) was performed in samples from HIV-1-positive patients. A total of 45 sequences were aligned with final manual adjustments. The phylogenetic analyses showed a higher prevalence of HIV-1 subtype B in the studied population (97.8%) with only one sample yielding an F1 subtype. The viral genotyping prediction showed that CCR5 tropism was the most prevalent in the studied cohort. Geno2pheno analysis showed that R5 and CXCR4 prediction were 69% and 31%, respectively. There was no statistical significance, either in viral load or in CD4(+) T cell count when R5 and X4 prediction groups were compared. Moreover, the GPGR tetramer was the most common V3 loop core motif identified in the HIV-1 strains studied (34.1%) followed by GWGR, identified in 18.1% of the samples. The high level of B subtype in this Brazilian population reinforces the nature of the HIV epidemic in Brazil, and corroborates previous data obtained in the Brazilian HIV-infected population.\",\"Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are newly emerged zoonotic paramyxoviruses discovered during outbreaks in Queensland, Australia in 1994 and peninsular Malaysia in 1998/9 respectively and classified within the new Henipavirus genus. Both viruses can infect a broad range of mammalian species causing severe and often-lethal disease in humans and animals, and repeated outbreaks continue to occur. Extensive laboratory studies on the host cell infection stage of HeV and NiV and the roles of their envelope glycoproteins have been hampered by their highly pathogenic nature and restriction to biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a henipavirus envelope glycoprotein pseudotyped lentivirus assay system using either a luciferase gene or green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene encoding human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) genome in conjunction with the HeV and NiV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins. Functional retrovirus particles pseudotyped with henipavirus F and G glycoproteins displayed proper target cell tropism and entry and infection was dependent on the presence of the HeV and NiV receptors ephrinB2 or B3 on target cells. The functional specificity of the assay was confirmed by the lack of reporter-gene signals when particles bearing either only the F or only G glycoprotein were prepared and assayed. Virus entry could be specifically blocked when infection was carried out in the presence of a fusion inhibiting C-terminal heptad (HR-2) peptide, a well-characterized, cross-reactive, neutralizing human mAb specific for the henipavirus G glycoprotein, and soluble ephrinB2 and B3 receptors. In addition, the utility of the assay was also demonstrated by an examination of the influence of the cytoplasmic tail of F in its fusion activity and incorporation into pseudotyped virus particles by generating and testing a panel of truncation mutants of NiV and HeV F. Together, these results demonstrate that a specific henipavirus entry assay has been developed using NiV or HeV F and G glycoprotein pseudotyped reporter-gene encoding retrovirus particles. This assay can be conducted safely under BSL-2 conditions and will be a useful tool for measuring henipavirus entry and studying F and G glycoprotein function in the context of virus entry, as well as in assaying and characterizing neutralizing antibodies and virus entry inhibitors.\",\"Memory CD4 T cells are the primary targets of HIV-1 infection, which then subsequently spreads to other T lymphocyte subsets. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) alters the pattern of HIV-1 distribution. Blood samples were collected from ART-na\\u00efve or -experienced HIV-1 patients, and the memory and na\\u00efve subsets of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, respectively, were isolated by cell sorting. DNA was extracted and the HIV-1 env C2/V3 region PCR amplified. Amplicons were cloned and sequenced, and genetic relatedness among different HIV-1 compartments was determined by the phylogenetic analysis of clonal sequences. The viral V3 sequence of HIV-1 in each compartment was analyzed by using webPSSM to determine CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor binding property of the virus. The direction of viral migration among involved compartments was determined by using the MacClade program. In ART-na\\u00efve patients, HIV-1 was generally confined to the memory CD4 T (mT4) cell compartment, even though in a few cases, na\\u00efve CD4 T (nT4) cells were also infected. When this occurred, the HIV-1 gene migrated from nT4 to mT4. In contrast, HIV-1 was detected in nT4 and mT4 as well as in the memory CD8 T (mT8) compartments of ART-experienced patients. However, no clear pattern of directional HIV-1 gene flow among the compartments could be determined because of the small sample size. All HIV-1-infected T cell compartments housed the virus that used either CCR5 or CXCR4 as the coreceptor.\",\"While some recently transmitted HIV clade C (HIV-C) strains exhibited tier 1 neutralization phenotypes, most were tier 2 strains (J Virol 2010; 84:1439). Because induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) through vaccination against tier 2 viruses has proven difficult, we have generated a tier 1, clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C) to permit efficacy testing of candidate AIDS vaccines against tier 1 viruses. SHIV-1157ipEL was created by swapping env of a late-stage virus with that of a tier 1, early form. After adaptation to rhesus macaques (RM), passaged SHIV-1157ipEL-p replicated vigorously in vitro and in vivo while maintaining R5 tropism. The virus was reproducibly transmissible intrarectally. Phylogenetically, SHIV-1157ipEL-p Env clustered with HIV-C sequences. All RM chronically infected with SHIV-1157ipEL-p developed high nAb titers against autologous as well as heterologous tier 1 strains. SHIV-1157ipEL-p was reproducibly transmitted in RM, induced cross-clade nAbs, and represents a tool to evaluate anti-HIV-C nAb responses in primates.\",\"Little is known about whether human CD4 positive T cells, the principal natural target of HIV-1, have intrinsic factors, other than the receptor/coreceptor molecules, which modulate the entry efficiency of HIV-1. In the present study, we found that human T cell lines, HUT78 and PM1, were less permissive to VSV-G-mediated HIV-1 infection compared with the Jurkat cell line. Furthermore, HUT78 cells were also less sensitive to HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, while PM1 cells became susceptible to HIV-1. Real-time PCR analyses showed that less susceptibility of the cells to HIV-1 was due to block at, or prior to, reverse transcription of viral RNA. To clarify the entry efficiency of HIV-1 into these cell lines, we analyzed the internalization of p24 Ag into the cytosolic and vesicular fractions of post-nuclear extracts at 4h post-infection. When the cells were infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped with VSV-G, the amount of p24 Ag in the cytosolic fractions in both HUT78 and PM1 cells was lower than that observed in Jurkat cells. In the case of HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, however, PM1 cells exhibited comparable amounts of p24 Ag in the cytosolic fraction compared with Jurkat cells, while the amount of p24 Ag in HUT78 cells remained low. Heterokaryon experiments between susceptible and less susceptible cell lines suggested that some inhibitory factors counteracted VSV-G-mediated viral entry in PM1 and HUT78 cells, and HIV-1 Env-mediated viral entry in HUT78 cells.\",\"To develop a sensitive phenotypic assay based on recombinant viruses (RVs) for characterizing HIV-1 tropism. Viral tropism was assessed in 159 plasma samples. The env gene was amplified and ligated into pNL-lacZ/env-Ren, which carries a luciferase reporter gene. Resulting constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells to generate RVs. To assess co-receptor tropism, U87.CD4.CXCR4/CCR5 cells were infected and luciferase activity was measured. RVs containing env from different HIV-1 subtypes were replication competent. Minor variants were detectable in 1% of the viral population. Tropism was determined in 65% of samples with a viral load of <1000 copies/mL. The phenotypic assay described here was validated with the Trofile\\u2122 and Trofile\\u2122ES assays. Considering the Trofile\\u2122 assay as a reference, the sensitivity for R5 and R5X4/X4 detection was 90% and 77%, and the specificity was 77% and 90%, respectively. Our assay was 86% concordant with Trofile\\u2122 (90% for R5 and 77% for R5X4/X4). When our system was compared with Trofile\\u2122ES, the concordance was 89% (86% for R5 and 92% for R5X4/X4), the sensitivity for R5 was 86% and for R5X4/X4 was 92%, and the specificity for R5 was 92% and for R5X4/X4 was 86%. The phenotypic results were compared with those obtained using the following V3 genotypic prediction tools: position-specific scoring matrix; geno2pheno[coreceptor]; C4.5; C4.5 using positions 8 and 12; PART; support vector machines; and the charge rule. We describe a system to assess co-receptor tropism based on the generation of chimeric replication-competent viruses with high sensitivity in the detection of minor populations. A good correlation of our results with Trofile\\u2122 assays was found.\",\"HIV-1 R5 viruses predominantly use CCR5 as a coreceptor to infect CD4(+) T cells and macrophages. While R5 viruses generally infect CD4(+) T cells, research over the past few years has demonstrated that they vary extensively in their capacity to infect macrophages. Thus, R5 variants that are highly macrophage tropic have been detected in late disease and are prominent in brain tissue of subjects with neurological complications. Other R5 variants that are less sensitive to CCR5 antagonists and use CCR5 differently have also been identified in late disease. These latter variants have faster replication kinetics and may contribute to CD4 T-cell depletion. In addition, R5 viruses are highly variable in many other properties, including sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors that block HIV-1 entry into cells. Here, we review what is currently known about how HIV-1 R5 viruses vary in cell tropism and other properties, and discuss the implications of this variation on transmission, pathogenesis, therapy and vaccines.\",\"Lentiviral vectors derived from the HIV-1 genome offer great promise for gene therapy due to their ability to transduce non-dividing cells and sustain long-term expression of transgenes. The majority of current lentiviral vectors are pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis viral envelope (VSV-G). VSV-G equips lentiviral vectors with a broad host cell tropism and increased stability. Increased particle stability enables viral supernatants to be concentrated by high-speed centrifugation to enhance their infectivity. Despite its efficacy, VSV-G is cytotoxic - a feature that prohibits the development of stable cell lines that constitutively express this envelope. Therefore, non-toxic envelope proteins are being investigated. RD114 is an attractive alternative because it also provides increased particle stability and its receptor is widely expressed on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In this study, the packaging efficiency of three envelope proteins, RD114, RDpro and VSV-G, were evaluated with two lentiviral vectors (TRIP GFP and HPV-402). RDpro is an RD114-HIV chimera designed to pseudotype lentiviral vectors more efficiently. In transient systems, VSV-G generated titers of 10(8) and 10(7) viral particles/mL for TRIP GFP and HPV-402. RDpro possessed titers of 10(7) and 10(6), while RD114 titers were one log lower for each vector. Despite having relatively lower titers, RD114 proteins are less toxic; this was demonstrated in the extension of transient transfection reactions from 48 to 96 h. VSV-G transfections are generally limited to 48 h. In regard to gene therapy applications, we show that RDpro supernatants efficiently transduce peripheral blood HSCs. The versatility of RD114 envelopes was again demonstrated by using a 'mixed' expression system; composed of stably expressed RD114 envelope proteins to pseudotype lentiviral vectors generated in trans (titer range 10(3)-10(5)). Our data show that RD114 envelope proteins are effective and versatile constructs that could prove to be essential components of therapeutic lentiviral gene transfer systems.\",\"The objectives of this study were to assess the performance of genotypic algorithms for predicting CXCR4-using virus, with enhanced sensitivity Trofile HIV coreceptor tropism assay (ES Trofile) as the reference, and to compare the concordance/accuracy of genotypic tests with ES Trofile and with the original Trofile assay. Paired phenotypic and genotypic determinations of HIV-1 coreceptor usage were compared in plasma samples from HIV-1-infected patients. Sequencing of the third hypervariable (V3) loop of the viral gene and phenotypic assays were performed for each sample. Genotypic rules used to predict tropism were Geno2pheno (false-positive rate at 1 to 20%), position-specific scoring matrix X4R5 (PSSM(X4R5)) and PSSM(sinsi) (where \\\"sinsi\\\" stands for syncytium inducing and non-syncytium inducing), and the 11/25, 11/24/25, and net charge rules. Two hundred forty-four phenotypic and genotypic samples were tested. Coreceptor usage was obtained from ES Trofile for 145 (59%) samples and from Trofile for 99 (41%) samples. The highest concordance (82.6%) was obtained with PSSM(X4R5) when ES Trofile was used as the reference. Geno2pheno at a 20% false-positive rate showed the highest sensitivity (76.7%) for CXCR4-using virus detection with ES Trofile. Samples from na\\u00efve subjects and those with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm(3) showed the best predictive performance. Overall, the accuracy of the bioinformatics tools to detect CXCR4-using virus was similar for ES Trofile and Trofile; however, the negative predictive values for genotypic tools with ES Trofile were slightly higher than they were with Trofile. The accuracy of genotypic algorithms for detecting CXCR4-using viruses is high when using ES Trofile as the reference. Results are similar to those obtained with Trofile. The concordance with ES Trofile is better with higher CD4 cell counts and nonexposure to antiretroviral therapy.\",\"We have recently constructed a series of novel human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1s) that are tropic for a macaque cell line (mt; macaque cell-tropic) to generate and establish a primate experimental system for HIV-1/AIDS study. In order to determine biological properties of these viruses effectively, several other macaque cell lines with distinct characteristics that can be routinely and easily used, instead of primary cells, for infection experiments are required. In this study, we have examined four macaque cell lines for their surface expression of virus receptor molecules and for their genotype of a major anti-viral capsid gene. Furthermore, we monitored the susceptibility of the cell lines to a standard simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) clone and three representative basic mt HIV-1 clones. Results obtained here have clearly indicated that these cell lines are exquisitely useful to characterize various SIVs and more importantly, mt HIV-1s.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infection affects about 1 to 2 million individuals, the majority living in West Africa, Europe, and India. As for HIV-1, new strategies for the prevention of HIV-2 infection are needed. Our aim was to produce new vaccine immunogens that elicit the production of broadly reactive HIV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Native and truncated envelope proteins from the reference HIV-2ALI isolate were expressed in vaccinia virus or in bacteria. This source isolate was used due to its unique phenotype combining CD4 independence and CCR5 usage. NAbs were not elicited in BALB/c mice by single immunization with a truncated and fully glycosylated envelope gp125 (gp125t) or a recombinant polypeptide comprising the C2, V3, and C3 envelope regions (rpC2-C3). A strong and broad NAb response was, however, elicited in mice primed with gp125t expressed in vaccinia virus and boosted with rpC2-C3. Serum from these animals potently neutralized (median 50% neutralizing titer, 3,200) six of six highly divergent primary HIV-2 isolates. Coreceptor usage and the V3 sequence of NAb-sensitive isolates were similar to that of the vaccinating immunogen (HIV-2ALI). In contrast, NAbs were not reactive on three X4 isolates that displayed major changes in V3 loop sequence and structure. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that broadly reactive HIV-2 NAbs can be elicited by using a vaccinia virus vector-prime/rpC2-C3-boost immunization strategy and suggest a potential relationship between escape to neutralization and cell tropism.\",\"Cysteine-cysteine receptor 5 (CCR5)-using viruses classically predominate during HIV-1 primary infection but the frequency of cysteine-X-cysteine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using viruses varies between studies and could be different between plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Thus, we determined HIV-1 tropism in both these compartments during primary infection and evaluated the impact of CXCR4-using viruses on disease progression. One hundred and thirty-three patients with primary HIV-1 infection were screened for HIV-1 coreceptor usage in plasma and PBMCs using both genotypic and phenotypic methods. The impact of CXCR4-using viruses' transmission on subsequent disease progression was assessed in a case-control study. HIV-1 coreceptor usage was determined using a recombinant virus phenotypic entry assay and V3-based genotypic algorithms. We also monitored CD4(+) T-cell count, clinical events and therapeutic intervention. There was 6.4% of CXCR4-using HIV-1 in plasma during primary infection as measured by a phenotypic assay and combined criteria from the 11/25 and net charge genotypic rules. Geno2pheno10 overestimated the prevalence of CXCR4-using viruses (12%). HIV-1 tropism in plasma and PBMCs was 98% concordant. The HIV-1 RNA load and CD4(+) T-cell count during primary infection were not related to virus tropism. Primary infection with CXCR4-using viruses was associated with an accelerated rate of disease progression, estimated by a faster decline of CD4 T-cell count under 350 cells/microl and by a reduced delay in initiating a first antiretroviral treatment. Plasma or PBMC samples can be used for determining HIV-1 tropism during primary infection. CXCR4-using viruses are rare during primary infection but increase the risk of disease progression.\",\"DC are major targets of HIV-1 during the early events of infection. Yet, HIV-1 infects these cells only inefficiently in vitro as compared with CD4+T lymphocytes. Accordingly, we have previously identified a strong post-entry block to HIV-1 replication in MDDC as a result of the cellular restriction factor A3G. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that As\\u2082O\\u2083, a drug used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, can fully eliminate the potent post-entry restriction of HIV-1 infection in MDDC and in blood-derived MyDC by mechanisms that were unclear. We are now exploring the interplay between As\\u2082O\\u2083 and A3G-mediated restriction in primary DC subsets. Here, we report that As\\u2082O\\u2083 counteracts A3G-mediated restriction in MyDC but not in MDDC. RNAi of A3G in MyDC indicated that the As\\u2082O\\u2083-mediated increase of HIV-1 infection was largely dependent on the presence of the cellular restriction factor. This study reveals an unexpected interplay between As\\u2082O\\u2083 and A3G-mediated restriction to HIV-1 infection in primary human MyDC.\",\"The MERIT study evaluated maraviroc versus efavirenz, both with zidovudine/lamivudine, in treatment-na\\u00efve patients with CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1. Post hoc analyses previously assessed week 48 outcomes in patients rescreened with R5 virus by a more sensitive tropism assay. Week 96 efficacy (post hoc, n = 614) and safety (n = 721) were assessed. Proportions of subjects <50 copies/mL (58.8% maraviroc, 62.7% efavirenz) and time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) responders (<50 copies/mL: 60.5% vs 60.7%) were similar. Maraviroc recipients had greater CD4 increases (+ 212 vs + 171 cells/mm(3)) and fewer adverse event discontinuations (6.1% vs 15.5%), malignancies, and category C events. Week 96 data confirm week 48 observations in MERIT.\",\"Few data are available about the efficacy of maraviroc (MVC) during routine use. We characterized indications for MVC use and the efficacy of MVC in clinical practice. Thirty-two patients treated with MVC at our institution between 2006 and 2009 were included. Genotypic (n +/- 31) and phenotypic (n +/- 13) tropism analysis was performed. We determined indications for MVC use, characteristics of antiretroviral combination partners and treatment outcome. Complete suppression of viral replication was achieved in 78% after 6 months. A median increase of 124 CD4+ cells/microl after 6 months was observed. Concordance between phenotypic and genotypic tropism was found in 75%. Indications for MVC treatment included treatment failure (n +/- 15), intolerance to previous antiretrovirals (n +/- 6) and add-on MVC for intensification without changing the current regimen (n +/- 11). The add-on strategy was used in patients with a relatively low viremia in order to achieve complete viral load suppression or in situations with suppressed viral load but judged as unstable due to an extensive resistance pattern. Salvage drugs most frequently combined with MVC were darunavir (n +/- 14) and raltegravir (n +/- 14). - The genotypic assay had predicted CXCR4 tropism in 5 patients, using a false positive rate (FPR) of 20%. Lowering the FPR to 5% predicted CCR5 tropism in 4 cases, still resulting in sustained complete viral response under MVC use. MVC containing salvage regimens achieve relevant CD4 cell increases and high viral response rates. In patients with few remaining treatment options it may be justified to lower the FPR-cutoff to 5% when predicting the coreceptor usage. Hereby, MVC could still be applied in selected patients with otherwise limited treatment options.\",\"Two distinct aspects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) biopathology with important implications for the management of treated patients have emerged during the last decade: changes in relative viral fitness, and viral tropism. First, it has been observed that HIV-1 accumulates deleterious mutations leading to drug resistance and different degrees of reduction in relative fitness during antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although the latter normally parallel a failure of ART resulting from selection of resistant mutants, the drop in viral replication capacity may be beneficial for the host. Moreover, specific antiviral compounds aimed at reducing viral fitness could be developed. Analysis of the determinants of viral fitness in highly evolving viral populations has shown that viral extinction may also be obtained by forcing highly dynamic viral populations through increased (lethal) mutagenesis that abolishes viral replication (violation of the error threshold). It could be of great interest in the near future to address this point with strategies specifically planned at the molecular level. Furthermore, diagnostic evaluation limited to the master sequence has low predictive value in rapidly evolving viral populations. These observations, together with the evidence that all of the methodologies currently used for fitness analysis have important limitations, strongly suggest that further research is warranted. This should use highly sensitive and flexible technologies to evaluate viral fitness directly in vivo or ex vivo, not only for the dominant mutants, but also for minority variants. Second, discovery of the two main co-receptors for HIV-1, CCR5 and CXCR4, has led to a better understanding of the interaction of the viral envelope with host cells and to the development of novel therapeutic agents that inhibit viral entry. In this perspective, analysis of HIV-1 tropism has acquired a major diagnostic role.\",\"A substantial number of HIV infections worldwide are diagnosed at a late stage of disease. Mortality in late presenters is high, and their treatment is a specific challenge. We have determined the relative proportions of HIV-1 strains of different coreceptor tropism (CRT) in this group of patients and investigated the impact of CRT on progression markers such as CD4 cell counts and viral load, and on the clinical presentation of the patients. Plasma samples from 50 treatment-naive patients with a late HIV diagnosis (CD4 cell counts of <200 cells/microl at the time of diagnosis) were analyzed. HIV strains were sequenced, and for CRT determination, the internet tool geno2pheno[coreceptor] was used, with a 20% false-positive rate as the cutoff. Differences in progression markers, patient characteristics and HIV subtype distribution between the R5-infected and X4/DM-infected patient groups were evaluated statistically. CRT predictions indicated that 62% of the patients had only R5-tropic strains. CRT was not associated with CD4 cell counts or viral load at the time of diagnosis. Only in very late presenters (CD4 cell counts <50 cells/microl) was there a significant difference in disease stage at the time of presentation, showing that patients with R5 more often were at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage C3 compared with those with X4/DM strains (P = 0.04). A substantial number of patients diagnosed at a late stage of HIV-1 infection may be infected exclusively with R5-tropic virus strains, making this specific patient group a possible candidate for coreceptor antagonist treatment.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 plays a critical role in the viral fusion process, and its N- and C-terminal heptad repeat domains serve as important targets for developing anti-HIV-1 drugs, like T-20 (generic name, enfuvirtide; brand name, Fuzeon). Here, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening on a human bone marrow cDNA library using the recombinant soluble gp41 ectodomain as the bait and identified a novel gp41 core-binding molecule, designated P20. P20 showed no homology with a current HIV fusion inhibitor, T-20, but had sequence homology to a human protein, troponin I type 3 interacting kinase (TNNI3K)-like protein. While it could bind to the six-helix bundle core structure formed by the N- and C-terminal heptad repeats, P20 did not interrupt the formation of the six-helix bundle. P20 was effective in blocking HIV-1 Env-mediated syncytium formation and inhibiting infection by a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains with distinct subtypes and coreceptor tropism, while it was ineffective against other enveloped viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus. P20 exhibited no significant cytotoxicity to the CD4(+) cells that were used for testing antiviral activity. Among the 11 P20 mutants, four analogous peptides with a common motif (WGRLEGRRT) exhibited significantly reduced anti-HIV-1 activity, suggesting that this region is the critical active site of P20. Therefore, this peptide can be used as a lead for developing novel HIV fusion inhibitors and as a probe for studying the membrane-fusogenic mechanism of HIV.\",\"During the course of infection, transmitted HIV-1 isolates that initially use CCR5 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4, which is associated with an accelerated progression to AIDS. Although this coreceptor switch is often associated with mutations in the stem of the viral envelope (Env) V3 loop, domains outside V3 can also play a role, and the underlying mechanisms and structural basis for how X4 tropism is acquired remain unknown. In this study we used a V3 truncated R5-tropic Env as a starting point to derive two X4-tropic Envs, termed DeltaV3-X4A.c5 and DeltaV3-X4B.c7, which took distinct molecular pathways for this change. The DeltaV3-X4A.c5 Env clone acquired a 7-amino-acid insertion in V3 that included three positively charged residues, reestablishing an interaction with the CXCR4 extracellular loops (ECLs) and rendering it highly susceptible to the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. In contrast, the DeltaV3-X4B.c7 Env maintained the V3 truncation but acquired mutations outside V3 that were critical for X4 tropism. In contrast to DeltaV3-X4A.c5, DeltaV3-X4B.c7 showed increased dependence on the CXCR4 N terminus (NT) and was completely resistant to AMD3100. These results indicate that HIV-1 X4 coreceptor switching can involve (i) V3 loop mutations that establish interactions with the CXCR4 ECLs, and/or (ii) mutations outside V3 that enhance interactions with the CXCR4 NT. The cooperative contributions of CXCR4 NT and ECL interactions with gp120 in acquiring X4 tropism likely impart flexibility on pathways for viral evolution and suggest novel approaches to isolate these interactions for drug discovery.\",\"HIV-1 is usually transmitted in the presence of semen. We have shown that semen boosts HIV-1 infection and contains fragments of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) forming amyloid aggregates termed SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of viral infection) that promote virion attachment to target cells. Despite its importance for the global spread of HIV-1, however, the effect of semen on virus infection is controversial. Here, we established methods allowing the meaningful analysis of semen by minimizing its cytotoxic effects and partly recapitulating the conditions encountered during sexual HIV-1 transmission. We show that semen rapidly and effectively enhances the infectivity of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. This enhancement occurs independently of the viral genotype and coreceptor tropism as well as the virus producer and target cell type. Semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection was also observed under acidic pH conditions and in the presence of vaginal fluid. We further show that the potency of semen in boosting HIV-1 infection is donor dependent and correlates with the levels of SEVI. Our results show that semen strongly enhances the infectivity of HIV-1 and other primate lentiviruses and that SEVI contributes to this effect. Thus, SEVI may play an important role in the sexual transmission of HIV-1 and addition of SEVI inhibitors to microbicides may improve their efficacy.\",\"While CCR5 is the principal coreceptor used by macrophage (M)-tropic HIV-1, not all primary CCR5-using (R5) viruses enter macrophages efficiently. Here, we used functionally-diverse R5 envelope (Env) clones to characterize virus-cell interactions important for efficient CCR5-mediated macrophage entry. The magnitude of macrophage entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses correlated with increased immunoreactivity of CD4-induced gp120 epitopes, increased ability to scavenge low levels of cell-surface CCR5, reduced sensitivity to the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, and increased dependence on specific residues in the CCR5 ECL2 region. These results are consistent with an altered and more efficient mechanism of CCR5 engagement. Structural studies revealed potential alterations within the gp120 V3 loop, the gp41 interaction sites at the gp120 C- and N-termini, and within the gp120 CD4 binding site which may directly or indirectly lead to more efficient CCR5-usage. Thus, enhanced gp120-CCR5 interactions may contribute to M-tropism of R5 HIV-1 strains through different structural mechanisms.\",\"HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance is an important threat to the success of antiretroviral therapy and transmitted resistance has reached 9% prevalence in Europe. Studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have a predictive value for disease progression, independently of CD4 counts and plasma viral load. Molecular-beacon-based real-time PCR was used to measure HIV-1 second template switch (STS) DNA in PBMC in newly-diagnosed HIV-1 patients across Europe. These patients were representative for the HIV-1 epidemic in the participating countries and were carrying either drug-resistant or sensitive viral strains. The assay design was improved from a previous version to specifically detect M-group HIV-1 and human CCR5 alleles. The findings resulted in a median of 3.32 log(10) HIV-1 copies/10(6) PBMC and demonstrated for the first time no correlation between cellular HIV-1 DNA load and transmitted drug-resistance. A weak association between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels with plasma viral RNA load and CD4(+) T-cell counts was also reconfirmed. Co-receptor tropism for 91% of samples, whether or not they conferred resistance, was CCR5. A comparison of pol sequences derived from RNA and DNA, resulted in a high similarity between the two. An improved molecular-beacon-based real-time PCR assay is reported for the measurement of HIV-1 DNA in PBMC and has investigated the association between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and transmitted resistance to antiretroviral therapy in newly-diagnosed patients from across Europe. The findings show no correlation between these two parameters, suggesting that transmitted resistance does not impact disease progression in HIV-1 infected individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor tropism predominance implies that both resistant and non-resistant strains behave similarly in early infection. Furthermore, a correlation found between RNA- and DNA-derived sequences in the pol region suggests that genotypic drug-resistance testing could be carried out on either template.\",\"Maraviroc (MVC) is the first approved CCR5 antagonist. The aim of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of MVC in treatment-experienced or treatment-resistant HIV-infected adults. The validated HIV microsimulation model ARAMIS was used to predict clinical and economic outcomes of treating patients with optimized background therapy (OBT) alone, as compared to a strategy of testing for the patient's viral tropism and treating with OBT with or without (+/-) MVC in a cohort corresponding to the MOTIVATE screening cohort. Compared to treatment with OBT alone, a treatment strategy of OBT +/- MVC (twice daily) according to tropism test result was predicted to increase CD4+ cell count after 5 years (from mean 249 to 360 cells/microL), undiscounted life expectancy (7.6 to 8.9 years), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; from 4.99 to 5.71) for an additional $40,500, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $56,400 per QALY gained. The result was relatively insensitive to alternative clinical and cost assumptions within reasonable ranges, but for individuals with HIV susceptible to only two or fewer components of OBT, the ICER decreased to $52,000 per QALY gained. MVC is cost-effective, especially among individuals with few remaining options for active antiretroviral therapy.\",\"An understanding of cellular factors that affect viral replication contributes to elucidation of the mechanism for the determination of viral tropism. Cyclophilin A (CypA), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), is an essential host factor for the efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human cells. However, its role in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication has not been determined. In the 2008 US-Japan AIDS panel meeting, I have presented the effect of cyclosporine A (CsA), a PPIase inhibitor, on replication of wild-type SIV. Interestingly, CsA treatment enhanced SIV replication in human cells but abrogated SIV replication in macaque cells, implying a species-specific effect of CsA on SIV replication. After this meeting, analysis using CypA knocked-down human cells indicated that CypA was considered inhibitory for SIV replication. These results suggest possible involvement of CypA in the determination of SIV tropism.\",\"HIV-1 R5 viruses vary widely in their capacity to infect primary macrophages. R5 macrophage-tropism is associated with an increased envelope:CD4 affinity that partly results from an increased exposure of CD4 contact residues on gp120 and allows the use of low levels of CD4 for infection. The selective pressures in vivo that modulate R5 macrophage-tropism are not understood. It is possible that different R5 variants adapt for replication in either T-cells (high CD4) or in macrophages (low CD4). However, other selective pressures in vivo (e.g. neutralizing antibodies) may also impact R5 tropism. Here, we measured macrophage infectivity conferred by gp120 sequences amplified sequentially from subjects in London followed from the acute stage of infection. We report wide variation in the capacity of these envelopes to confer macrophage infection in the complete absence of both autologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies. Our data show that the variation in macrophage tropism observed at early times cannot have been influenced by neutralizing antibodies.\",\"Human breastmilk provides a rich source of commensal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to the infant during breastfeeding and stimulates abundant growth and colonization of these bacteria at mucosal surfaces in the infant gastrointestinal tract. While conferring critical nutritional and immunologic support to the developing newborn, breastmilk also serves as a vehicle for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission from mother to child during breastfeeding. Whether breastmilk LAB confer protection against mucosal exposure to HIV-1 in breastfeeding infants is unknown. In the present study, we sought to evaluate LAB isolated from the breastmilk of healthy women for the ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection in vitro. A total of 38 strains of breastmilk bacteria were evaluated in this study. Both heat-killed bacteria and cell-free conditioned supernatants from bacterial cultures were tested for the ability to inhibit infection with HIV-1 using viral isolates with tropism for CCR5 (R5), CXCR4 (X4), or R5/X4 dual-tropism. Significant inhibition of R5-tropic HIV-1 was demonstrated using heat-killed bacteria, most notably among breastmilk strains of Lactobacillus and Pediococcus. Selected strains of breastmilk LAB also demonstrated significant inhibition of HIV-1 infection against virus with tropism for X4 and R5/X4. These results demonstrate for the first time that commensal LAB from human breastmilk inhibit HIV-1 infection in vitro and suggest a possible role for these bacteria in mucosal protection against HIV-1 in the breastfeeding infant.\",\"The use of maraviroc as part of a simplification of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is hampered by the difficulty of assessing viral tropism in patients with undetectable viraemia. In this context, information on tropism might be obtained from testing either older stored viraemic sera collected before initiation of ART or current proviral DNA in peripheral blood cells. HIV-1-infected individuals who had initiated ART and had undetectable viraemia for >2 years were identified. V3 genotyping was performed in parallel from plasma HIV-RNA and proviral DNA before starting ART and from proviral DNA while on suppressive ART. Viral tropism was interpreted using geno2pheno (false positive rate = 10%) and an optimized version of position specific scoring matrices (PSSM) with a greater sensitivity to detect X4 variants (PSSM(X4/R5-8)). A total of 78 HIV-1 infected individuals were examined. Mean time under suppressive ART was 3.5 years (interquartile range: 2.3-4.4). The rate of X4 variants in plasma and proviral DNA samples at baseline was 32.8% and 34.0%, respectively. It was 33.9% after >2 years of suppressive ART in DNA samples. Paired RNA/DNA tropism results at baseline could be obtained for 38 patients, with an overall 82% concordance. After >2 years of suppressed plasma viraemia, HIV tropism was re-assessed in proviral DNA; tropism switches were uncommon, especially comparing baseline and most recent DNA longitudinal specimens (12%). HIV tropism switches over time under suppressive ART are rare. There is a relatively good correlation between RNA and DNA tropism estimations using genotypic tests. Thus, HIV-1 tropism might confidently be examined either in older stored viraemic plasma specimens or in current proviral DNA samples.\",\"Entry inhibitors represent a new class of antiretroviral agents for the treatment of infection with HIV-1. While resistance to other HIV drug classes has been well described, resistance to this new class is still ill defined despite considerable clinical use. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed: tropism switching (utilization of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 for entry), increased affinity for the coreceptor, increased rate of virus entry into host cells, and utilization of inhibitor-bound receptor for entry. In this review we will address the development of attachment, fusion, and coreceptor entry inhibitors and explore recent studies describing potential mechanisms of resistance.\",\"Evaluation of the reliability of several V3-based genotypic predictors to infer viral tropism in patients infected with B and non-B strains of HIV-1. Several genotypic tropism predictors were evaluated in plasma (RNA) samples from 198 HIV-1-infected patients, taking as gold standard the results of the phenotypic recombinant virus assay Phenoscript((R)). In addition, for 37 B subtype HIV-1 patients the phenotypic results from plasma samples were also compared with tropism predictions based on V3 amplification from paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A total of 150 paired genotypic/phenotypic results were obtained from plasma specimens. Concordance values ranged from 63% to 85%, depending on the genotypic algorithm used. The best predictors in terms of sensitivity/specificity to detect X4 variants were WebPSSM(X4/R5) (77%/87%), Geno2pheno(FPR) (=) (5%) (80%/77%) and an algorithm combining the '11/25' and 'Net charge' rules, termed Garrido's rule (80%/79%). The performance of genotypic predictors was better testing B than non-B clades. The overall sensitivity ranged from 28% to 94%, reaching 100% in subtype B antiretroviral-experienced patients using WebPSSM(SI/NSI), Geno2pheno(FPR) (> or =) (5%) and Garrido's rule. Conversely, the sensitivity when testing non-B subtypes was poorer, ranging from 17% to 67%. Interestingly, the correlation between genotypic and phenotypic results was better when testing PBMCs than plasma using all genotypic predictors. Genotypic tools based on V3 sequences may provide reliable information on HIV-1 tropism when testing clade B viruses, especially in antiretroviral-experienced patients. The sensitivity to detect X4 variants using genotypic tools may improve by testing proviral DNA instead of plasma RNA.\",\"We previously reported on a panel of HIV-1 clade B envelope (Env) proteins isolated from a patient treated with the CCR5 antagonist aplaviroc (APL) that were drug resistant. These Envs used the APL-bound conformation of CCR5, were cross resistant to other small-molecule CCR5 antagonists, and were isolated from the patient's pretreatment viral quasispecies as well as after therapy. We analyzed viral and host determinants of resistance and their effects on viral tropism on primary CD4(+) T cells. The V3 loop contained residues essential for viral resistance to APL, while additional mutations in gp120 and gp41 modulated the magnitude of drug resistance. However, these mutations were context dependent, being unable to confer resistance when introduced into a heterologous virus. The resistant virus displayed altered binding between gp120 and CCR5 such that the virus became critically dependent on the N' terminus of CCR5 in the presence of APL. In addition, the drug-resistant Envs studied here utilized CCR5 very efficiently: robust virus infection occurred even when very low levels of CCR5 were expressed. However, recognition of drug-bound CCR5 was less efficient, resulting in a tropism shift toward effector memory cells upon infection of primary CD4(+) T cells in the presence of APL, with relative sparing of the central memory CD4(+) T cell subset. If such a tropism shift proves to be a common feature of CCR5-antagonist-resistant viruses, then continued use of CCR5 antagonists even in the face of virologic failure could provide a relative degree of protection to the T(CM) subset of CD4(+) T cells and result in improved T cell homeostasis and immune function.\",\"Traditional antibody-mediated neutralization of HIV-1 infection is thought to result from the binding of antibodies to virions, thus preventing virus entry. However, antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV-1 are rare and are not induced by current vaccines. We report that four human anti-phospholipid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (PGN632, P1, IS4, and CL1) inhibit HIV-1 CCR5-tropic (R5) primary isolate infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with 80% inhibitory concentrations of <0.02 to approximately 10 microg/ml. Anti-phospholipid mAbs inhibited PBMC HIV-1 infection in vitro by mechanisms involving binding to monocytes and triggering the release of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta. The release of these beta-chemokines explains both the specificity for R5 HIV-1 and the activity of these mAbs in PBMC cultures containing both primary lymphocytes and monocytes.\",\"HIV-1 is one of the fastest evolving pathogens, and is distinguished by geographic and genetic variants that have been classified into different subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Early in infection the primary coreceptor is CCR5, but during disease course CXCR4-using HIV-1 populations may emerge. This has been correlated with accelerated disease progression in HIV-1 subtype B. Basic knowledge of HIV-1 coreceptor tropism is important due to the recent introduction of coreceptor antagonists in antiretroviral therapy, and subtype-specific differences regarding how frequently HIV-1 CXCR4-using populations appear in late-stage disease need to be further investigated. To study how frequently CXCR4-using populations appear in late-stage disease among HIV-1 subtype A and CRF02_AG, we evaluated the accuracy of a recombinant virus phenotypic assay for these subtypes, and used it to determine the HIV-1 coreceptor tropism of plasma samples collected during late-stage disease in Guinea-Bissau. We also performed a genotypic analysis and investigated subtype-specific differences in the appearance of CXCR4 tropism late in disease. We found that the recombinant virus phenotypic assay accurately predicted HIV-1 coreceptor tropism of subtype A and CRF02_AG. Over the study period (1997-2007), we found an increasing and generally high frequency of CXCR4 tropism (86%) in CRF02_AG. By sequence analysis of the V3 region of our samples we developed a novel genotypic rule for predicting CXCR4 tropism in CRF02_AG, based on the combined criteria of the total number of charged amino acids and net charge. This rule had higher sensitivity than previously described genotypic rules and may be useful for development of future genotypic tools for this CRF. Finally, we conducted a literature analysis, combining data of 498 individuals in late-stage disease, and found high amounts of CXCR4 tropism for all major HIV-1 subtypes (60-77%), except for subtype C (15%). The increase in CXCR4 tropism over time suggests an evolving epidemic of CRF02_AG. The results of the literature analysis demonstrate the need for further studies investigating subtype-specific emergence for CXCR4-tropism; this may be particularly important due to the introduction of CCR5-antagonists in HIV treatment regimens.\",\"Expression vectors have been used widely to identify functionally important domains in HIV-1 glycoproteins. Env domains such as the V3 loop were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into plasmids carrying the backbone of an HIV-1 reference strain like NL4-3. The hypothesis of the present approach was that cloning large domains of wild type envelopes yields constructs that are non-functional in co-receptor-expressing HeLaCD4 cells, in contrast to laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains. The background for this assumption was that primary HIV-1 virions are frequently less infectious and lack fusion capacity in HeLaCD4 cells compared to laboratory-adapted (LA) viruses. To address this hypothesis, env domains of different length were amplified from a panel of X4-tropic HIV-1 clinical isolates cultured in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and cloned into the backbone of NL4-3 env. Constructs bearing either the V3 loops or 312 nucleotides of the intracellular trunk (ICT) of gp41 led to a similar fusion capacity as NL4-3. In contrast, none of the plasmids carrying the 2322 N-terminal nucleotides of primary isolates led to similar syncytium formation. These results have an effect on studies that investigate pathogenic effects of Env regions with chimeric constructs in the backbone of HIV reference envelopes.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor use and viral evolution were analyzed in blood samples from an HIV-1 infected patient undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Coreceptor use was predicted in silico from sequence data obtained from the third variable loop region of the viral envelope gene with two software tools. Viral diversity and evolution was evaluated on the same samples by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods. In addition, phenotypic analysis was done by comparison of viral growth in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a CCR5 (R5)-deficient T-cell line which was controlled by a reporter assay confirming viral tropism. In silico coreceptor predictions did not match experimental determinations that showed a consistent R5 tropism. Anti-HIV directed antibodies could be detected before and after the SCT. These preexisting antibodies did not prevent viral rebound after the interruption of antiretroviral therapy during the SCT. Eventually, transplantation and readministration of anti-retroviral drugs lead to sustained increase in CD4 counts and decreased viral load to undetectable levels. Unexpectedly, viral diversity decreased after successful SCT. Our data evidence that only R5-tropic virus was found in the patient before and after transplantation. Therefore, blocking CCR5 receptor during stem cell transplantation might have had beneficial effects and this might apply to more patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, we revealed a scenario of HIV-1 dynamic different from the commonly described ones. Analysis of viral evolution shows the decrease of viral diversity even during episodes with bursts in viral load.\",\"An efficient mode of HIV-1 infection of CD4 lymphocytes occurs in the context of infectious synapses, where dendritic cells (DCs) enhance HIV-1 transmission to lymphocytes. Emergence of CXCR4-using (X4) HIV-1 strains occurs late in the course of HIV-1 infection, suggesting that a selective pressure suppresses the switch from CCR5 (R5) to X4 tropism. We postulated that SDF-1/CXCL12 chemokine production by DCs could be involved in this process. We observed CXCL12 expression by DCs in vivo in the parafollicular compartment of lymph nodes. The role of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mMDDCs) in transmitting R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains to autologous lymphocytes was studied using an in vitro infection system. Using this model, we observed a strong enhancement of lymphocyte infection with R5, but not with X4, viruses. This lack of DC-mediated enhancement in the propagation of X4 viruses was proportional to CXCL12 production by mMDDCs. When CXCL12 activity was inhibited with specific neutralizing antibodies or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), the block to mMDDC transfer of X4 viruses to lymphocytes was removed. These results suggest that CXCL12 production by DCs resident in lymph nodes represents an antiviral mechanism in the context of the infectious synapse that could account for the delayed appearance of X4 viruses.\",\"Ectopic expression of pluripotency gene sets provokes nuclear reprogramming in permissive somatic tissue environments generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The evolutionary conserved function of stemness orthologs was here tested through interspecies transduction. A spectrum of HIV-based lentiviral vectors was designed, and point mutations in the HIV-1 capsid region identified for efficient infectivity and expanded trans-species tropism. Human pluripotent gene sequences, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC, packaged into engineered lentiviral expression vectors achieved consistent expression in non-human fibroblasts. Despite variation in primary amino-acid sequence between species, introduction of human pluripotent genes produced cell lines with embryonic stem cell-like morphology. Transduced fibroblasts differentiated in vitro into all three germ layers according to gastrulation gene expression profiles, and formed in vivo teratoma with multi-lineage potential. Reprogrammed progeny incorporated into non-human morula to produce blastomeres capable of developing into chimeric embryos with competent organogenesis. This model system establishes a prototypic approach to examine consequences of human stemness factors induced reprogramming in the context of normal embryonic development, exploiting non-human early stage embryos. Thus, ectopic xeno-transduction across species unmasks the promiscuous nature of stemness induction, suggesting evolutionary selection of core processes for somatic tissue reprogramming.\",\"Most treated HIV-1 patients have undetectable viral loads and the strategies for managing long-term side effects may involve a new class of antiretroviral-like CCR5 antagonists. Tropism determination based on proviral DNA sequence is necessary for patients with a fully suppressed plasma viral load, as assays analysing DNA phenotypes have yet to be developed. We aimed to analyse HIV-1 tropism using proviral DNA sequencing and the associated factors, in a group of patients on antiretroviral (ARV) treatment with an undetectable viral load in plasma. Blood samples of 140 HIV-1-infected ARV-treated patients with a plasma viral load of <40 copies/mL were studied. All patients had never been treated with CCR5 antagonists. Co-receptor usage was determined using proviral DNA from the V3 env region sequence by Geno2Pheno (false positive rate 10%) and PSSM algorithms. Among 140 patients treated using ARV therapy with a fully suppressed plasma viral load, at least 70% of patients had proviral R5-tropic virus. Among all the studied factors (time since HIV infection diagnosis, treatment duration, time since viral load undetectability, HIV subtype, current treatment, age, number of treatment types, sex, genotypic susceptibility score, and nadir and current CD4 cell counts), nadir CD4 T cell count alone was associated with tropism during a multivariate analysis. R5X4/X4 tropism was present in all nadir CD4 categories. Proviral DNA tropism determination should be required, even for patients with a CD4 nadir cell count >350 cells/mm(3), before CCR5 antagonists are used in patients with a fully suppressed plasma viral load.\",\"To determine the prevalence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 among treatment-experienced patients in Spain. Epidemiologic, cross-sectional, and non-interventional study between January and June 2008 in HIV-1-infected patients in Spain. A total of 485 treatment-experienced patients from across Spainand with a plasma viral load of not greater-than1000 copies/mL were studied. Viral tropism, CD4+ cell count, plasma viral load, stage of disease, and current treatment strategies were determined. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine association of coreceptor use with patients' characteristics. Coreceptor usage was determined by viral tropism assays: 290 (68.9%) patients had CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus, and 131 (31.1%) had dual-tropic/mixed or CXCR4 virus variants. Mean CD4+ cell counts in the R5 group (319.4 cells/mm3) were higher than in the non-R5 group (237.9 cells/mm3) (p = .0005). There was an inverse relationship between CD4+ cell counts and plasma viral load, but regression analyses on covariates associated with CCR5 tropism showed that only a higher CD4+ cell number was significantly associated with CCR5 coreceptor usage. The prevalence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 among treatment-experienced patients in Spain is higher than previously found in other geographical settings. We did not find independent markers predictive of coreceptor usage other than a relationship with CD4+ levels.\",\"Although X4 tropic SHIVs have been studied extensively, they show distinct infection phenotypes from those of R5 tropic viruses, which play an important role in HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis. To augment the variety of R5 tropic SHIVs, we generated a new R5 tropic SHIV from the highly pathogenic X4 tropic SHIV-KS661, a derivative of SHIV-89.6. Based on consensus amino acid alignment analyses of subtype B R5 tropic HIV-1, five amino acid substitutions in the third variable region successfully changed the secondary receptor preference from X4 to R5. Improvements in viral replication were observed in infected rhesus macaques after two passages, and reisolated virus was designated SHIV-MK38. SHIV-MK38 maintained R5 tropism through in vivo passages and showed robust replication in infected monkeys. Our study clearly demonstrates that a minimal number of amino acid substitutions in the V3 region can alter secondary receptor preference and increase the variety of R5 tropic SHIVs.\",\"HIV infection is pandemic in humans and is responsible for millions of deaths every year. The discovery of new cellular targets that can be used to prevent the infection process represents a new opportunity for developing more effective antiviral drugs. In this context, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a lectin expressed at the surface of immature dendritic cells and involved in the initial stages of HIV infection, is a promising therapeutic target. Herein we show the ability of a new tetravalent dendron containing four copies of a linear trimannoside mimic to inhibit the trans HIV infection process of CD4+ T lymphocytes at low micromolar range. This compound presents a high solubility in physiological media, a neglectable cytotoxicity, and a long-lasting effect and is based on carbohydrate-mimic units. Notably, the HIV antiviral activity is independent of viral tropism (X4 or R5). The formulation of this compound as a gel could allow its use as topical microbicide.\",\"The increasing prevalence of HIV-1 subtype B' in China and Southeast Asia calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model to study viral transmission and pathogenesis. Because there are significant differences between subtype B' HIV-1 and other chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency viru (SHIVs) in the env gene, a novel SHIV, designated SHIV(B'WHU), was generated by replacing counterparts of SHIV(SF33) with tat/rev/vpu/env genes derived from a primary, CCR5-tropic, subtype B' HIV-1 strain of a Chinese patient. SHIV(B'WHU) was able to replicate in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used CCR5 as its major coreceptor. Moreover, after serial passages in Chinese macaques, the in vivo infectivity of SHIV(B'WHU) was enhanced, yet no significant sequence changes were found in viral envelopes, and the virus did not change its CCR5-tropism. CD4(+) T-cell loss, however, was found in the intraepithelial lymphocytes of small intestines of infected macaques. Our findings have implications in understanding the early pathogenesis of SHIV(B'WHU) in Chinese macaques.\",\"A variety of methods are available to determine HIV-1 co-receptor usage, commonly referred to as viral tropism. This article reviews recent data on phenotypic and genotypic assays of HIV-1 tropism. Tropism assays are used to determine co-receptor usage of HIV-1 in patients who may be candidates for treatment with CCR5 antagonists. Phenotypic assays are used most often in the clinical trials of CCR5 antagonists, and are considered the 'gold standard' for comparison with other methods of tropism testing. Enhancements have allowed detection of a lower threshold of minor CXCR4-using species. When compared with phenotypic assays, genotypic methods have poor sensitivity but good specificity at detecting CXCR4-using HIV-1. Preliminary results from a recent comparative study suggest that some genotypic methods may perform as well as phenotypic tests in predicting virologic response to CCR5 antagonists. Several studies show that tropism testing may provide useful prognostic information regarding the risk of disease progression. Understanding the characteristic of different tropism assays is important for their clinical use. Although phenotypic testing currently is favored, genotypic assays may be a suitable alternative in appropriate settings.\",\"Lentiviral vectors have broad target cell tropism and efficient machinery to integrate transgenes into the host genome. Modification of these vectors by incorporating heterologous proteins into virions has relied mostly on the fusion of proteins into the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr. Vpr expression can be harmful for cells and its gene has been deleted from third-generation vector production plasmids. We therefore developed a direct integrase fusion protein strategy as an alternative way to package heterologous proteins into vectors. The method was tested by creating two different integrase fusion proteins, IN-p53 and IN-mCherry, cloned into the 3' end of pol in the packaging plasmid. Lentiviral vectors were produced by conventional methods, using the modified packaging plasmids. Vector-incorporated fusion proteins were correctly processed from Gag-Pol, retained the ability to catalyze transgene integration, and showed fusion protein-specific activity by being fluorescent or inducing apoptosis. Functional third-generation lentiviral vectors containing IN-fusion proteins can thus be produced by standard production protocols independent of Vpr expression. Our results suggest that this packaging method is useful for lentiviral vector-mediated protein transduction, such as intranuclear meganuclease, transposon, or zinc finger protein delivery, intracellular imaging of vector particles, and generation of modified lentiviral vectors that contain both toxic and nontoxic IN-fusion proteins.\",\"Clinical trials of CCR5 antagonists have relied on the phenotypic determination of HIV-1 coreceptor usage. Few phenotypic assays are available, with few data on their concordance, and none has been designed to determine tropism from cell-associated HIV-1 DNA. To assess the performance of the new Toulouse Tropism Test (TTT) phenotypic assay to characterize HIV-1 tropism using blood plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). 434 plasma and 168 PBMC samples were tested with the TTT assay. We determined the correlation between our assay results on plasma samples and those of the commercial Trofile assay. The TTT assay determined the tropism of 97% of samples after successful amplification of the env gene. It performed well on both cell samples and plasma samples with various HIV-1 loads and subtypes. It detected 0.5% of minor CXCR4-using variants in the virus population. The TTT and the Trofile assays were >90% concordant for predicting HIV-1 tropism. We have validated a new recombinant virus phenotypic assay for determining HIV-1 tropism using both plasma and cell samples from patients who are candidates for treatment with CCR5 antagonists.\",\"Microbicides are women-controlled prophylactics for sexually transmitted infections. The most important class of microbicides target HIV-1 and contain antiviral agents formulated for topical vaginal delivery. Identification of new viral entry inhibitors that target the HIV-1 envelope is important because they can inactivate HIV-1 in the vaginal lumen before virions can come in contact with CD4+ cells in the vaginal mucosa. Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs) demonstrate the ability to act as entry inhibitors due to their ability to bind to glycans and prevent gp120 binding to CD4+ cells. However, as proteins they present significant challenges in regard to economical production and formulation for resource-poor environments. We have synthesized water-soluble polymer CBAs that contain multiple benzoboroxole moieties. A benzoboroxole-functionalized monomer was synthesized and incorporated into linear oligomers with 2-hydroxypropylmethacrylamide (HPMAm) at different feed ratios using free radical polymerization. The benzoboroxole small molecule analogue demonstrated weak affinity for HIV-1BaL gp120 by SPR; however, the 25 mol % functionalized benzoboroxole oligomer demonstrated a 10-fold decrease in the K(D) for gp120, suggesting an increased avidity for the multivalent polymer construct. High molecular weight polymers functionalized with 25, 50, and 75 mol % benzoboroxole were synthesized and tested for their ability to neutralize HIV-1 entry for two HIV-1 clades and both R5 and X4 coreceptor tropism. All three polymers demonstrated activity against all viral strains tested with EC(50)s that decrease from 15000 nM (1500 microg mL(-1)) for the 25 mol % functionalized polymers to 11 nM (1 microg mL(-1)) for the 75 mol % benzoboroxole-functionalized polymers. These polymers exhibited minimal cytotoxicity after 24 h exposure to a human vaginal cell line.\",\"Nine anionic water-soluble calix[4]arene species, incorporating sulfonate, carboxylate or phosphonate groups, six of them incorporating two 2,2'-bithiazole subunits in alternate position at the lower rim, have been synthesised and evaluated as anti-HIV agents on various HIV strains and cells of the lymphocytic lineage (HIV-1 III B/MT4, HIV-1 LAI/CEM-SS, HIV-1 Bal/PBMC), using AZT as reference compound. A toxicity was detected for a minority of compounds on PBMC whereas for the others no cellular toxicity was measured at concentrations up to 100 microM. Most of the compounds have an antiviral activity in a 10-50 microM range, and one of them, sulfonylated, displays its activity, whatever the tropism of the virus, at a micromolar concentration.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) infects target cells through interaction with the CD4 molecule and chemokine receptors, mainly CCR5 and CXCR4. Viral isolates can be phenotypically classified based on the co-receptor they utilize to infect target cells. Thus, R5 and X4 virus use respectively CCR5 and CXCR4, whereas R5X4 virus can use either CCR5 or CXCR4. This review describes the central role played by co-receptor expression and usage for HIV-1 cell tropism, transmission and pathogenesis. We discuss various hypotheses proposed to explain the preferential transmission of R5 viruses and the mechanisms driving the change of HIV-1 co-receptor usage in the course of infection. Recent insights in the intrinsic variability of R5 viruses and their role in influencing disease progression in both adults and children are also discussed.\",\"The recombinant envelope protein (gp120) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CRF01_AE env gene isolated from the corresponding blood (rgp120-F36PC) and genital fluid (rgp120-F36VC) specimens obtained from HIV infected individuals was successfully produced in both prokaryote and eukaryote cells. The yields of HIV-1 recombinant envelope proteins rgp120-F36PC and rgp120-F36VC produced in E. coli and in mammalian cells were 1.0 and 1.2, and 0.3 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. Antibody responses in mice immunized with rgp120-F36VC protein were not significantly higher than those with rgp120-F36PC protein. The level of antibody response in mice immunized with V3 deleted recombinant gp120 proteins from rgp120-F36VC and rgp120-F36PC was not significantly different from wild type rgp120 proteins. beta-strands at the tip of the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope protein were predicted for the wild type genital fluid isolate but not for the wild type blood isolate. The replication capacity of both F36PC and F36VC was quite efficient. The infectivity assay of the epithelial cell line for pNL4-3/gp120F36VC was better than for pNL4-3/gp120F36PC. The extra beta-strands in the V3 loop may be involved in cell tropism.\",\"NaN\",\"Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells characterized by the suppressive activity they exert on effector immune responses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific immune responses. Because Treg express CXCR4 and CCR5, they represent potential targets for HIV; however, Treg susceptibility to HIV infection is still unclear. We therefore performed an extensive study of Treg susceptibility to HIV, using lab strains and primary isolates with either CCR5 or CXCR4 tropism. Furthermore, we quantified HIV infection at early and late time points of the virus life cycle. We found that Treg were clearly susceptible to HIV infection. Circulating Treg were not preferentially infected with HIV compared to effector T cells (Teff) in vivo. Conversely, in vitro infection with either CCR5-using (R5) or CXCR4-using (X4) viruses occurred with different dynamics. For instance, HIV infection by R5 viruses (lab strains and primary isolates) resulted in lower levels of infection in Treg compared with Teff at both early and late time points. In contrast, X4 viruses induced higher levels of infection in Treg compared to Teff at early time points, but this difference disappeared at the late time points of the virus life cycle. Our results suggest that the relative susceptibility of Treg to HIV infection compared to Teff varies, depending on both viral and host factors. These variations may play an important role in HIV pathogenesis.\",\"The V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is critical for coreceptor binding and is the main determinant of which of the cellular coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4, the virus uses for cell entry. The aim of this study is to provide a large-scale data driven analysis of HIV-1 coreceptor usage with respect to the V3 loop evolution and to characterize CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viral phenotypes previously studied in small- and medium-scale settings. We use different sequence similarity measures, phylogenetic and clustering methods in order to analyze the distribution in sequence space of roughly 1000 V3 loop sequences and their tropism phenotypes. This analysis affords a means of characterizing those sequences that are misclassified by several sequence-based coreceptor prediction methods, as well as predicting the coreceptor using the location of the sequence in sequence space and of relating this location to the CD4(+) T-cell count of the patient. We support previous findings that the usage of CCR5 is correlated with relatively high sequence conservation whereas CXCR4-tropic viruses spread over larger regions in sequence space. The incorrectly predicted sequences are mostly located in regions in which their phenotype represents the minority or in close vicinity of regions dominated by the opposite phenotype. Nevertheless, the location of the sequence in sequence space can be used to improve the accuracy of the prediction of the coreceptor usage. Sequences from patients with high CD4(+) T-cell counts are relatively highly conserved as compared to those of immunosuppressed patients. Our study thus supports hypotheses of an association of immune system depletion with an increase in V3 loop sequence variability and with the escape of the viral sequence to distant parts of the sequence space.\",\"HIV-1 is a small retrovirus that wreaks havoc on the human immune system. It is a puzzle to the scientific community how a virus that encodes only nine proteins can take complete control of its host and redirect the cell to complete replication or maintain latency when necessary. One way to explain the control elicited by HIV-1 is through numerous protein partners that exist between viral and host proteins, allowing HIV-1 to be intimately involved in virtually every aspect of cellular biology. In addition, we postulate that the complexity exerted by HIV-1 can not merely be explained by the large number of protein-protein interactions documented in the literature but, rather, cell-type-specific interactions and post-translational modifications of viral proteins must be taken into account. We use HIV-1 Tat and its influence on viral transcription as an example of cell-type-specific complexity. The influence of post-translational modifications (acetylation and methylation), as well as subcellular localization on Tat binding partners, is also discussed.\",\"HIV-1 is frequently detected in the lungs of infected individuals and is likely important in the development of pulmonary opportunistic infections. The unique environment of the lung, rich in alveolar macrophages and with specialized local immune responses, may contribute to differential evolution or selection of HIV-1. We characterized HIV-1 in the lung in relation to contemporaneous viral populations in the blood. The C2-V5 region of HIV-1 env was sequenced from paired lung (induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) and blood (plasma RNA and proviral DNA from sorted or unsorted PBMC) from 18 subjects. Compartmentalization between tissue pairs was assessed using 5 established tree or distance-based methods, including permutation tests to determine statistical significance. We found statistical evidence of compartmentalization between lung and blood in 10/18 subjects, although lung and blood sequences were intermingled on phylogenetic trees in all subjects. The subject showing the greatest compartmentalization contained many nearly identical sequences in BAL sample, suggesting clonal expansion may contribute to reduced viral diversity in the lung in some cases. However, HIV-1 sequences in lung were not more homogeneous overall, nor were we able to find a lung-specific genotype associated with macrophage tropism in V3. In all four subjects in whom predicted X4 genotypes were found in blood, predicted X4 genotypes were also found in lung. Our results support a picture of continuous migration of HIV-1 between circulating blood and lung tissue, with perhaps a very limited degree of localized evolution or clonal replication.\",\"The cellular innate immune response to HIV-1 is poorly characterized. In view of HIV-1 tropism for macrophages, which can be activated via pattern recognition receptors to trigger antimicrobial defences, we investigated innate immune responses to HIV-1 by monocyte-derived macrophages. In a model of productive HIV-1 infection, cellular innate immune responses to HIV-1 were investigated, at the level of transcription factor activation, specific gene expression and genome-wide transcriptional profiling. In addition, the viral determinants of macrophage responses and the physiological effect of innate immune cellular activation on HIV-1 replication were assessed. Productive HIV-1 infection did not activate nuclear factor-kappaB and interferon regulatory factor 3 transcription factors or interferon gene expression (IFN) and caused remarkably small changes to the host-cell transcriptome, with no evidence of inflammatory or IFN signatures. Evasion of IFN induction was not dependent on HIV-1 envelope-mediated cellular entry, inhibition by accessory proteins or reverse transcription of ssRNA that may reduce innate immune cellular activation by viral RNA. Furthermore, IFNbeta priming did not sensitize responses to HIV-1. Importantly, exogenous IFNbeta or stimulation with the RNA analogue poly I:C to simulate innate immune activation invoked HIV-1 restriction. We conclude that macrophages lack functional pattern recognition receptors for this virus and that HIV-1 tropism for macrophages helps to establish a foothold in the host without triggering innate immune cellular activation, which would otherwise block viral infection effectively.\",\"The affinity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope for CD4 and CCR5 appears to be associated with aspects of R5 virus (virus using the CCR5 coreceptor) pathogenicity. However, entry efficiency results from complex interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein and both CD4 and CCR5, which limits attempts to correlate viral pathogenicity with surrogate measures of envelope CD4 and CCR5 affinities. Here, we present a system that provides a quantitative and comprehensive characterization of viral entry efficiency as a direct interdependent function of both CD4 and CCR5 levels. This receptor affinity profiling system also revealed heretofore unappreciated complexities underlying CD4/CCR5 usage. We first developed a dually inducible cell line in which CD4 and CCR5 could be simultaneously and independently regulated within a physiologic range of surface expression. Infection by multiple HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates could be examined simultaneously for up to 48 different combinations of CD4/CCR5 expression levels, resulting in a distinct usage pattern for each virus. Thus, each virus generated a unique three-dimensional surface plot in which viral infectivity varied as a function of both CD4 and CCR5 expression. From this functional form, we obtained a sensitivity vector along with corresponding metrics that quantified an isolate's overall efficiency of CD4/CCR5 usage. When applied to viral isolates with well-characterized sensitivities to entry/fusion inhibitors, the vector metrics were able to encapsulate their known biological phenotypes. The application of the vector metrics also indicated that envelopes derived from elite suppressors had overall-reduced entry efficiencies compared to those of envelopes derived from chronically infected viremic progressors. Our affinity-profiling system may help to refine studies of R5 virus tropism and pathogenesis.\",\"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens.\",\"We screened 150 individuals from two recent seroconverter cohorts and found that six (4%) had CXCR4-using viruses. Clonal analysis of these six individuals, along with a seventh individual identified during clinical care as a recent seroconverter, revealed the presence of both X4- and dual-tropic variants in these recently infected adults. The ability of individual CXCR4-using variants to infect cells expressing CD4/CXCR4 or CD4/CCR5 varied dramatically. These data demonstrate that virus populations in some newly infected individuals can consist of either heterogeneous populations containing both CXCR4-using and CCR5-tropic viruses, or homogeneous populations containing only CXCR4-using viruses. The presence of CXCR4-using viruses at early stages of infection suggests that testing for viral tropism before using CCR5 antagonists may be important even in persons with known recent infection. The presence of CXCR4-using viruses in a subset of newly infected individuals could impact the efficacies of vaccine and microbicide strategies that target CCR5-tropic viruses.\",\"Because previous reports found an association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, we investigated whether HIV and HCV may reciprocally influence viral replication in monocyte lineage cells in vivo. Using a novel technique called simultaneous ultrasensitive subpopulation staining/hybridization in situ (SUSHI), we rapidly and unequivocally identified HCV reservoirs in peripheral blood from HCV-infected individuals with and without HIV coinfection. We found that HCV infects both CD14(+), CD16(+)(+) monocytic cells and CD14(+)(+), CD16(+)(+) monocytic cells but not CD14(+)(+), CD16- cells in individuals infected with HCV with or without HIV coinfection. To address these HCV tropism differences, we found that the HCV receptor CD81 is highly expressed on CD14(+), CD16(+)(+) and CD14(+)(+), CD16(+)(+) cells but not on monocytes (CD14(+)(+), CD16-). These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection, mother-to-child transmission of HCV, and possible virus-virus interactions in HCV-HIV coinfected individuals.\",\"Macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues are an important cellular reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, particularly in the later stages of disease. Macrophage-tropic HIV strains have an enhanced capacity to enter cells expressing low levels of CD4 through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we use a panel of primary HIV envelopes from brain and lymphoid tissues to examine the relationship between neutralization sensitivity to reagents targeting the CD4 binding site and virus entry into macrophages. Neutralization assays using pseudotyped viruses showed an association between the capacity of HIV to enter macrophages and increased sensitivity to the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) b12, which recognizes a conserved epitope overlapping the CD4 binding site, but not sensitivity to soluble CD4 (sCD4) or b6, a non-neutralizing CD4 binding site mAb. Furthermore, loss of an N-linked glycosylation site at position 386 in the V4 region of Env enhanced macrophage tropism together with b12 sensitivity, but not neutralization by sCD4, b6, or a broadly neutralizing AIDS patient serum. These findings suggest that exposure of the b12 epitope, rather than exposure of the CD4 binding site per se, enhances HIV macrophage tropism, possibly by exposing a region on the outer domain of gp120 that is initially recognized by CD4. These findings suggest overlap between specific gp120 determinants in or near the b12 epitope and those conferring macrophage tropism.\",\"Like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), most simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains use CCR5 to establish infection. However, while HIV-1 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4, SIVs that utilize CXCR4 have rarely been reported. To explore possible barriers against SIV coreceptor switching, we derived an R5X4 variant, termed 239-ST1, from the R5 clone SIVmac239 by serially passaging virus in CD4(+) CXCR4(+) CCR5(-) SupT1 cells. A 239-ST1 env clone, designated 239-ST1.2-32, used CXCR4 and CCR5 in cell-cell fusion and reporter virus infection assays and conferred the ability for rapid, cytopathic infection of SupT1 cells to SIVmac239. Viral replication was inhibitable by the CXCR4-specific antagonist AMD3100, and replication was abrogated in a novel CXCR4(-) SupT1 line. Surprisingly, parental SIVmac239 exhibited low-level replication in SupT1 cells that was not observed in CXCR4(-) SupT1 cells. Only two mutations in the 239-ST1.2-32 Env, K47E in the C1 domain and L328W in the V3 loop, were required for CXCR4 use in cell-cell fusion assays, although two other V3 changes, N316K and I324M, improved CXCR4 use in infection assays. An Env cytoplasmic tail truncation, acquired during propagation of 239-ST1 in SupT1 cells, was not required. Compared with SIVmac239, 239-ST1.2-32 was more sensitive to neutralization by five of seven serum and plasma samples from SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques and was approximately 50-fold more sensitive to soluble CD4. Thus, SIVmac239 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4 with high efficiency, but the changes required for this phenotype may be distinct from those for HIV-1 CXCR4 use. This finding, along with the increased neutralization sensitivity of this CXCR4-using SIV, suggests a mechanism that could select strongly against this phenotype in vivo.\",\"We previously reported the existence of CXCR4-using HIV-1 in 6-14 week-old Ugandan infants. Whether these viruses were transmitted from the mother perinatally or evolved after transmission is not known. In the current study, we investigated the origin of the CXCR4-using viruses in these infants by comparing HIV-1 envelope clones from the infants to those from their mothers at or near the time of delivery. Envelope clones were isolated from five Ugandan infant plasma samples that harbored CXCR4-using viruses, collected at the time of HIV diagnosis (four at birth, one at week 6), and from their mothers at delivery. Coreceptor usage and phylogenetic relatedness of HIV-1 populations in mother-infant pairs were analyzed in detail using the Trofile assay and sequence analysis of envelope clones, respectively. X4-tropic clones were identified in two mother-infant pairs and dual-tropic clones were found in three pairs, either alone or in combination with R5-tropic viruses. Dual-tropic clones varied in their ability to infect CXCR4-expressing cells. In each mother-infant pair, X4-tropic or dual-tropic clones shared similar phenotypic profiles and V3 sequence patterns; gp160 sequences of X4-tropic and dual-tropic clones from infants were phylogenetically indistinguishable from those of their mothers. The virus populations were phylogenetically homogenous in three infants and segregated according to coreceptor tropism in the remaining two infants. This study demonstrates that X4-tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 can be transmitted from mother to infant, before, during or shortly after delivery, and establishes vertical transmission as an important source of CXCR4-using viruses in infants.\",\"The paper presents the data of a comparative analysis of various bioinformation methods for evaluating the tropism of HIV-1 subtype A that is typical of Russia. The prevalence of CXCR4- and CCR5-tropic viruses among the variants prevailing in Russia was studied using the B-PSSM (sinsi) prediction method. No X4-tropic variants were found among 124 samples of HIV-1 isolated from the Russian patients not receiving antiretrovirus therapy.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission selects for virus variants with genetic characteristics distinct from those of donor quasispecies, but the biological factors favoring their transmission or establishment in new hosts are poorly understood. We compared primary target cell tropisms and entry coreceptor utilizations of donor and recipient subtype C Envs obtained near the time of acute infection from Zambian heterosexual transmission pairs. Both donor and recipient Envs demonstrated only modest macrophage tropism, and there was no overall difference between groups in macrophage or CD4 T-cell infection efficiency. Several individual pairs showed donor/recipient differences in primary cell infection, but these were not consistent between pairs. Envs had surprisingly broad uses of GPR15, CXCR6, and APJ, but little or no use of CCR2b, CCR3, CCR8, GPR1, and CXCR4. Donors overall used GPR15 better than did recipients. However, while several individual pairs showed donor/recipient differences for GPR15 and/or other coreceptors, the direction of the differences was inconsistent, and several pairs had unique alternative coreceptor patterns that were conserved across the transmission barrier. CCR5/CCR2b chimeras revealed that recipients as a group were more sensitive than were donors to replacement of the CCR5 extracellular loops with corresponding regions of CCR2b, but significant differences in this direction were not consistent within pairs. These data show that sexual transmission does not select for enhanced macrophage tropism, nor for preferential use of any alternative coreceptor. Recipient Envs are somewhat more constrained than are donors in flexibility of CCR5 use, but this pattern is not universal for all pairs, indicating that it is not an absolute requirement.\",\"Renal biopsy data indicate that tubular epithelial cells serve as a reservoir for HIV-1 infection. We studied the effect of HIV-1 gp120 envelope gene expression on tubular cell apoptosis. HIV-1 gp120 was expressed in a lentiviral vector pHR-CMV-IRES2-EGFP-DeltaB. This plasmid construct was used to produce pseudotyped virus using VSV-G envelope to enhance the tropism for efficient viral transduction. Human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells were transduced and assayed for cellular injury by trypan blue exclusion, Hoechst and PI staining, TUNEL, and cell cycle staging. HIV-1 gp120-transduced HK-2 cells showed cellular injury in a time-dependent manner. Gp120-transduced cells showed 2.5-fold greater apoptosis when compared with vector-transduced cells. Cell cycle analysis did not reveal any alteration between gp120-transduced cells and vector-transduced cells. Gp120-transduced cells showed higher expression of both Fas and FasL, whereas pretreatment with anti-FasL antibody partially inhibited gp120-induced tubular cell apoptosis. Similarly, pretreatment with caspase-8 inhibitor attenuated gp120-induced HK2 cell apoptosis. Moreover, gp120-transduced cells showed activation of caspase 8. These results suggest that HIV-1 gp120 expression induces tubular cell apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway by enhancing Fas and FasL expression and activation of caspase-8.\",\"This report describes the development, optimization and implementation of a persistent cell-based system to test inhibitors of hepatitis C (HCV) translation. The assay is based on a heterologous human immunodeficiency virus-1/simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/SIV) lentiviral vector expressing the bicistronic cassette containing the firefly and renilla luciferase genes, respectively, as reporters, and the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) inserted in between, under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The drug target in this assay is the HCV IRES, the activity of which leads to modulation of the renilla luciferase gene expression under its control, which is monitored by luminometry. The system has been validated using interferon (IFN), which is still the only consensual antiviral agent against HCV infection, associated with ribavirin. This bicistronic vector, extended to other viral IRESs and assayed in different cell lines, exhibited weak cell tropism, allowing its broad use in gene therapy, which frequently needs a multicistronic transfer vector to follow the expression of a gene of interest inside the target cells with the aid of a reporter, a drug selection marker, or a suicide gene, expressed from the same transcript.\",\"To estimate the frequency of viruses with X4 or dual-X4/DM tropism from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 390 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype-B patients diagnosed at the time of primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) between 1996 and 2007 and enrolled in the PRIMO Cohort. V3 loop sequences were amplified from HIV-1-DNA and analysed with a combination of five genotypic rules to predict tropism: (i) the '11/25 rule'; (ii) the net charge rule; (iii) the PSSM(X4/DM) algorithm; (iv) the PSSM(SI/NSI) algorithm; and (v) the SVM(Geno2pheno) algorithm. A high proportion (62/390, 15.9%) of patients harboured X4/DM-tropic viruses. This prevalence was stable over time: 18.1% before 2003 versus 14.8% since 2003. No difference according to HIV tropism was noted in HIV-RNA levels, CD4 cell count, time between infection and enrolment, and HIV infection risk factor. The frequency of X4/DM-tropic virus was similar among patients infected with a resistant virus (12/62, 19.4%) compared with patients harbouring wild-type strains (50/328, 15.2%). This large French epidemiological study evidenced a high proportion of patients (15.9%) harbouring X4/DM-tropic viruses in PBMCs at the time of PHI, suggesting the existence of a cellular X4/DM viral reservoir that could persist for lengthy period of time. Several reports identified that HIV-1 CXCR4 usage was more frequent among patients who developed AIDS and was a powerful predictor of the response to antiretrovirals. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of such strains on the outcome of HIV disease, when they are detected at the time of primary infection.\",\"Adenovirus (Ad) vectors have been developed as human immunodeficiency-1 (HIV-1) vaccine vectors because they consistently induce immune responses in preclinical animal models and human trials. Strong promoters and codon-optimization are often used to enhance vaccine-induced HIV-1 gene expression and immunogenicity. However, if the transgene is inherently cytotoxic in the cell line used to produce the vector, and is expressed at high levels, it is difficult to rescue a stable Ad HIV-1 vaccine vector. Therefore we hypothesized that generation of Ad vaccine vectors expressing cytotoxic genes, such as HIV-1 env, would be more efficient if expression of the transgene was down-regulated during Ad rescue. To test this hypothesis, a Lac repressor-operator system was applied to regulate expression of reporter luciferase and HIV-1 env transgenes during Ad rescue. The results demonstrate that during Ad rescue, constitutive expression of the Lac repressor in 293 cells reduced transgene expression levels to approximately 5% of that observed in the absence of regulation. Furthermore, Lac-regulation translated into more efficient Ad rescue compared to traditional 293 cells. Importantly, Ad vectors rescued with this system showed high levels of transgene expression when transduced into cells that lack the Lac repressor protein. The Lac-regulated system also facilitated the rescue of modified Ad vectors that have non-native receptor tropism. These tropism-modified Ad vectors infect a broader range of cell types than the unmodified Ad, which could increase their effectiveness as a vaccine vector. Overall, the Lac-regulated system described here (i) is backwards compatible with Ad vector methods that employ bacterial-mediated homologous recombination, (ii) is adaptable for the engineering of tropism-modified Ad vectors, and (iii) does not require co-expression of regulatory genes from the vector or the addition of exogenous chemicals to induce or repress transgene expression. This system therefore could facilitate the development of Ad-based vaccine candidates that otherwise would not be feasible to generate.\",\"The in vitro model of HIV-1 transcytosis through a monolayer of HEC-1 cells is thought to mimic the mucosal crossing of the virus that may occur in vivo. We evaluated whether the stimulation of HEC-1 by HIV may modulate HIV infection of macrophages. Thus, the ability to capture, produce, and transfer R5 viruses to T cells, attract T cells, and finally produce cytokines/chemokines, was compared between untreated macrophages (M0) and macrophages differentiated in the presence of medium collected at the basolateral pole of HEC-1, which were unstimulated [M(BL)] or stimulated with either R5-HIV-1Ba-L [M(BL-R5)] or X4-HIV-1NDK [M(BL-X4)]. M(BL-X4)-secreted CCR5-interacting chemokines integrated and replicated HIV less efficiently than did M(BL) and M(BL-R5). M(BL-R5) and M(BL-X4) similarly transmitted HIV to activated T cells. Interestingly, mannose-binding receptors and heparan sulfate proteoglycans were variously involved in HIV adsorption, whereas DC-SIGN mostly mediated the HIV transfer. Conversely to M(BL) and M(BL-X4), M(BL-R5) did not secrete eotaxin, GRO, ITAC, lymphotactin, MIP-1, MIP-3, and RANTES, which was associated with a weak capacity to recruit CD4(+)CXCR4(+)CCR5(+) T cells. In particular, M(BL-R5) specifically released soluble factors enhancing HIV production by recruited T cells. These submucosal-conditioned macrophages differentially captured, produced, and transferred R5-HIV-1 to T cells, according to the tropism of the virus deposited at the apical pole of HEC-1. These observations challenge the question of the in vivo involvement of HIV-1 as a supraepithelial stimulus that likely modulates the susceptibility for HIV-1 of submucosal target cells in favor of its transmission.\",\"Transmission of HIV from mother to child through breast-feeding remains a global health challenge, particularly in developing countries. Breast milk from an HIV-infected women may contain both cell-free HIV-1 and cell-associated virus; however, the impact of human breast milk on HIV infection and replication in CD4 cells remain poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of breast milk in vitro on infection of CD4 cells with cell-free HIV-1, including effects on HIV-1 receptor expression, reverse transcription, integration, and viral transcription. Additionally, we evaluated the ability of breast milk to inhibit cell-associated transmission of HIV-1 from infected CD4 T lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that breast milk potently inhibits infection with cell-free HIV-1 in vitro independently of viral tropism and significantly decreases HIV-1 reverse transcription and integration in CD4 cells. However, the inhibitory effect of breast milk on HIV-1 infection of CD4 cells was lost during extended culture, and direct coculture of HIV-infected CD4 T lymphocytes with susceptible target cells revealed that breast milk was ineffective at blocking cell-associated HIV-1 infection. Our findings suggest that breast milk may provide a protective function against cell-free HIV-1 but may be less effective at blocking infection by cell-associated virus.\",\"HIV-1 entry into target cells is a complex multistage process involving the envelope glycoprotein, primary cellular receptor CD4, and at least two main cellular coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4. The identification of the HIV-1 coreceptors led to the rapid development of several drug candidates that selectively block this interaction, that is, CCR5 or CXCR4 antagonists. Here, we review different methodologies used to determine the ability of the virus to use one or both coreceptors and their potential role in managing HIV-infected individuals treated with these novel drugs. Most commercially available HIV-1 tropism assays are cell-based (phenotypic) tests, which use different methodologies to generate env-recombinant viruses and distinct detection systems. On the other hand, a large effort is being devoted to develop more robust bioinformatic (genotypic) tools that may expedite HIV-1 tropism assays without compromising their accuracy. The main goal, however, continues to be to improve the sensitivity to detect minor CXCR4-tropic variants within the in-vivo HIV-1 quasispecies. An accurate determination, and perhaps quantification, of HIV-1 coreceptor usage is necessary for the successful management of HIV-infected individuals in the new era of entry inhibitors. Further studies, aimed to the development of novel methodologies, are essential for the success of this new class of drugs.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates differ in their use of coreceptors to enter target cells. This has important implications for both viral pathogenicity and susceptibility to entry inhibitors, recently approved or under development. Predicting HIV-1 coreceptor usage on the basis of sequence information is a challenging task, due to the high variability of the envelope. The associations of the whole HIV-1 envelope genetic features (subtype, mutations, insertions-deletions, physicochemical properties) and clinical markers (viral RNA load, CD8(+), CD4(+) T cell counts) with viral tropism were investigated, using a set of 2896 (659 after filter, 593 patients) sequence-tropism pairs available at the Los Alamos HIV database. Bootstrapped hierarchical clustering was used to assess mutational covariation. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to assess the relative importance of different features. Different machine learning (logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, rule bases, instance based reasoning) and feature selection (filter and embedded) methods, along with loss functions (accuracy, AUC of ROC curves, sensitivity, specificity, f-measure), were applied and compared for the classification of X4 variants. Extra-sample error estimation was assessed via multiple cross-validation and adjustments for multiple testing. A high-performing, compact, and interpretable logistic regression model was derived to infer HIV-1 coreceptor tropism for a given patient [accuracy = 92.76 (SD 3.07); AUC = 0.93 (SD 0.04)].\",\"Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains isolated from the brain use CCR5 for entry into macrophages and microglia. Strains that use both CCR5 and CXCR4 for entry (R5X4 strains) have been identified in the brains of some individuals, but mechanisms underlying the persistence of R5X4 viruses compartmentalized between the brain and other tissue reservoirs are unknown. Here, we characterized changes in the HIV-1 envelope (Env) that enhance the tropism of R5X4 variants for brain or lymphoid tissue. R5X4 Envs derived from the brains of two individuals had enhanced CCR5 usage in fusion assays compared to R5X4 Envs derived from matched spleen or blood, which was associated with reduced dependence on specific residues in the CCR5 N terminus and extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) and ECL3 regions. In contrast, spleen/blood-derived Envs had enhanced CXCR4 usage compared to brain-derived Envs, which was associated with reduced dependence on residues in the CXCR4 N terminus and ECL2 region. Consequently, brain-derived Envs had preferential CCR5 usage for HIV-1 entry into the JC53 cell line, could use either CCR5 or CXCR4 for entry into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and could use CCR5 (albeit inefficiently) for entry into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whereas the entry of spleen-derived Envs was CXCR4 dependent in all three cell types. Mutagenesis studies of Env amino acid variants influencing coreceptor usage showed that S306 in the gp120 V3 region of brain-derived Envs reduces dependence on the CCR5 N terminus and enhances CCR5 usage for HIV-1 entry into PBMC and MDM, whereas R306 in spleen-derived Envs reduces dependence on the CXCR4 N terminus and confers the CXCR4 restricted phenotype. These results identify mechanisms underlying R5X4 HIV-1 persistence in different tissue reservoirs. Tissue-specific changes in the gp120 V3 region that increase the efficiency of CCR5 or CXCR4 usage, and thereby influence coreceptor preference, may enhance the tropism of R5X4 strains for CCR5-expressing macrophage lineage cells in the brain and CXCR4-expressing T cells in lymphoid tissues, respectively.\",\"Assessment of HIV tropism using bioinformatic tools based on V3 sequences correlates poorly with results provided by phenotypic tropism assays, particularly for recognizing X4 viruses. This may represent an obstacle for the use of CCR5 antagonists. An algorithm combining several bioinformatic tools might improve the correlation with phenotypic tropism results. A total of 200 V3 sequences from HIV-1 subtype B, available in several databases with known phenotypic tropism results, were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of seven different bioinformatic tools (PSSM, SVM, C4.5 decision tree generator and C4.5, PART, Charge Rule, and Geno2pheno). The best predictive bioinformatic tools were identified, and a model combining several of these was built. Using the 200 reference sequences, SVM and geno2-pheno showed the highest sensitivity for detecting X4 viruses (98.8% and 93.7%, respectively); however, their specificity was relatively low (62.5% and 86.6%, respectively). For R5 viruses, PSSM and C4.5 gave the same results and outperformed other bioinformatic tools (95.7% sensitivity, 82% specificity). When results from three out of these four tools were concordant, the sensitivity and specificity, taking as reference the results from phenotypic tropism assays, were over 90% in predicting either R5 or X4 viruses (AUC: 0.9701; 95% CI: 0.9358-0.9889). An algorithm combining four distinct bioinformatic tools (SVM, geno2pheno, PSSM and C4.5), improves the genotypic prediction of HIV tropism, and merits further evaluation, as it might prove useful as a screening strategy in clinical practice.\",\"Human T-cell lymphotropic viruses type 1 and 2 are retroviruses that share the same routes of transmission as HIV-1. Since these agents are prevalent simultaneously in different parts of the world, coinfection is a frequently reported event. However, prevalence rates of coinfection differ for distinct populations and regions of the world or for each virus, with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 being more prevalent among HIV-1-infected individuals in the Southern hemisphere, while type 2 is more frequently found in the Northern hemisphere. In common, they share the tropism for T-lymphocytes, although human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and HIV-1 are predominantly CD4+ T-cell tropic and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 preferentially infects CD8+ cells. The biological properties of HIV-1 are distinct of those found in human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1/2. This fact makes possible an in vivo interaction between these agents, when coinfecting the same patients, with potentially relevant clinical implications. The available evidence suggests a protective role for coinfection by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 on AIDS progression. This hypothesis is supported by several laboratory evidences, as well as by a number of clinical studies that found no significant interaction between human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 and HIV-1, or even detected a protective effect on HIV-1 disease. On the other hand, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 seems to be a significant cofactor, with a potentially important role in HIV-1 infection. Although the clinical evidence is still controversial with regard to the real impact that coinfection exerts on clinical evolution, the majority of studies suggest it is associated with a modification of the natural history of HIV-1 infection, with a faster clinical progression and a shorter survival time. The main limitation of the available data is due to methodological problems in the majority of studies, which weaken the validity of their conclusions. A common finding in coinfection by both human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 is the increase in CD4+ cell count, but without any additional immune benefit for patients. Due to the limited available data, we need more, larger studies, designed to respond to the pending questions on the real significance of coinfection by these retroviruses.\",\"Maraviroc is the first co-receptor antagonist to be approved for use in HIV infected patient. In a phase II trial, in which the drug was administered as a single therapy, the most suitable maintenance dose was 300 mg, once or twice per day. The MOTIVATE double blind, placebo-compared studies, were carried out on patients infected by HIV-1 with R5 tropism and resistant to drugs from three families of retrovirals. Maraviroc two times per day achieved < 50 copies/mL in 45.5% of the patients compared to 16.7% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The CD4+ lymphocyte count had a mean of 63 cells/mm(3) higher with Maraviroc. The drug was shown to be superior in all patient groups regardless of the baseline viral load, the baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count or the number of accompanying active drugs. In the study on patients infected by HIV with X4/dual/mixed tropism, Maraviroc, was not virologically effective, but did produce a CD4 increase higher than the placebo. Maraviroc was compared with Efavirenz in the study on patients with no previous treatment and with R5-tropic virus. At 48 weeks, the percentage of patients with a viral load of <50 copies/mL was 69.3% in the group that received Efavirenz and 65.3% in the Maraviroc group. In conclusion, Maraviroc has demonstrated its increased efficacy in patients with CCR5-tropic virus and a long history of antiretroviral use and failure, and in patients with no previous treatment.\",\"Inhibition of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor is an encouraging new approach to pharmacotherapy against HIV. The HIV-1 strain makes use of either the CCR5 or the CXCR4 coreceptor to gain access into host CD4+ cells. Maraviroc, the first HIV-1 CCR5 coreceptor antagonist, blocks entry of HIV-1. This recently approved drug has demonstrated clinically significant decreases in plasma concentrations of HIV-1 RNA and increases in CD4+ cell counts; however, it is indicated only for use as salvage therapy. Drug resistance is a concern, as is selective pressure on viral coreceptor use, because viral coreceptor targets may switch as disease progresses. In addition, before maraviroc therapy can be started, costly assays are required to determine the host's viral coreceptor tropism. Emerging therapies targeting CXCR4, the other HIV coreceptor, have shown promise in decreasing plasma concentrations of HIV-1 RNA. Long-term studies with both targets are required to explore the critical issues of efficacy and immunologic safety, as the function of these coreceptors is linked to host chemokine pathways.\",\"Genetic differences between blood and mucosal-derived HIV-1 strains have been widely reported. As amplification of HIV-1 strains from mucosal samples including semen or saliva by co-culture has low sensitivity, we developed the construction of chimeric viruses expressing wild-type seminal HIV-1 envelope protein. Chimeric viruses were produced by co-transfection of a V1-V3 deleted pNL 43 vector and PCR fragments spanning the deleted region, amplified from HIV-1 RNA positive seminal plasma samples. After an initial testing of co-receptor usage by a tropism recombinant test, replication capacity and amplification of these recombinant viruses were assessed using PBMC. Four chimeric replicative strains, all using CXCR4 as coreceptor, were produced. The interaction between cell-free viral particles and reporter cell lines was assessed by confocal microscopy. These replicative chimeras exhibiting HIV-1 env from seminal strains represent useful tools for the in vitro study of the heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 and testing of microbicide activity.\",\"Virus-associated cell membrane proteins acquired by HIV-1 during budding may give information on the cellular source of circulating virions. In the present study, by applying immunosorting of the virus and of the cells with antibodies targeting monocyte (CD36) and lymphocyte (CD26) markers, it was possible to directly compare HIV-1 quasispecies archived in circulating monocytes and T lymphocytes with that present in plasma virions originated from the same cell types. Five chronically HIV-1 infected patients who underwent therapy interruption after prolonged HAART were enrolled in the study. The analysis was performed by the powerful technology of ultra-deep pyrosequencing after PCR amplification of part of the env gene, coding for the viral glycoprotein (gp) 120, encompassing the tropism-related V3 loop region. V3 amino acid sequences were used to establish heterogeneity parameters, to build phylogenetic trees and to predict co-receptor usage. The heterogeneity of proviral and viral genomes derived from monocytes was higher than that of T-lymphocyte origin. Both monocytes and T lymphocytes might contribute to virus rebounding in the circulation after therapy interruptions, but other virus sources might also be involved. In addition, both proviral and circulating viral sequences from monocytes and T lymphocytes were predictive of a predominant R5 coreceptor usage. However, minor variants, segregating from the most frequent quasispecies variants, were present. In particular, in proviral genomes harboured by monocytes, minority variant clusters with a predicted X4 phenotype were found. This study provided the first direct comparison between the HIV-1 quasispecies archived as provirus in circulating monocytes and T lymphocytes with that of plasma virions replicating in the same cell types. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing generated data with some order of magnitude higher than any previously obtained with conventional approaches. Next generation sequencing allowed the analysis of previously inaccessible aspects of HIV-1 quasispecies, such as co-receptor usage of minority variants present in archived proviral sequences and in actually replicating virions, which may have clinical and therapeutic relevance.\",\"We pseudotyped HIV-1 vectors with cytoplasmic tail-truncated envelope glycoproteins of a wild-type (WT) measles virus (MV). The particles entered the lymphatic cells exclusively through the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150), whereas particles pseudotyped with the MV vaccine strain glycoproteins also recognized the ubiquitous membrane cofactor protein (CD46) as receptor and had less specific cell entry. MV(WT)-HIV vectors reached titers of 10(8) t.u. ml(-1), which were up to 10-fold higher than those of MV(Vac)-HIV vectors, and discriminated between SLAM-positive and SLAM-negative cells, also in mixed cell cultures. As these vectors transduce primary human cells more efficiently than vesicular stomatitis virus-G pseudotyped vectors do, they are promising candidates for gene transfer to human lymphocytes and certain epithelial cells.\",\"To assess the effect of HIV coreceptor tropism (CRT) on the relative risk of progression to a composite outcome of CD4 count < or =350 cells per microliter, treatment initiation, or death. CRT assays were performed after study closure in baseline samples obtained from enrollees in a prospectively monitored cohort of treatment-naive adults with > or =450 CD4 cells per microliter and > or =1000 HIV-1 RNA copies per milliliter. Dual/mixed (D/M) and R5 CRT were detected in 32 and 282 patients, respectively. The baseline CD4 count (617 versus 694 cells/microL; P = 0.05) differed in patients with D/M versus R5 CRT. Otherwise, baseline laboratory characteristics were similar.The relative risk of progression to the composite end point was 2.15 (P = 0.002) for D/M versus R5 CRT, 2.07 per 1.0 log10 higher viral load (P < 0.001) and 0.87 per 50 cells per microliter higher CD4 cell count (P < 0.001). The effect of D/M CRT was also significant in separate analyses of time to initiation of antiretroviral therapy or CD4 cell count < or =350 cells per microliter. Untreated patients with D/M rather than R5 CRT had a faster rate of disease progression, whether assessed by a composite outcome of time to CD4 count < or =350 cells per microliter, treatment initiation, or death or by separate analyses of time to CD4 count < or =350 cells per microliter or treatment initiation.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) V3 loop is essential for coreceptor binding and principally determines tropism for the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors. Using the dual-tropic virus HIV-1(R3A), we previously made an extensive panel of V3 deletions and identified subdomains within V3 that could differentially mediate R5 and X4 tropism. A deletion of residues 9 to 12 on the N-terminal side of the V3 stem ablated X4 tropism while leaving R5 tropism intact. This mutation also resulted in complete resistance to several small-molecule CCR5 inhibitors. Here, we extend these studies to further characterize a variant of this mutant, Delta9-12a, adapted for growth in CCR5(+) SupT1 cells. Studies using coreceptor chimeras, monoclonal antibodies directed against the CCR5 amino terminus (NT) and extracellular loops, and CCR5 point mutants revealed that, relative to parental R3A, R5-tropic Delta9-12a was more dependent on the CCR5 NT, a region that contacts the gp120 bridging sheet and V3 base. Neutralization sensitivity assays showed that, compared to parental R3A, Delta9-12a was more sensitive to monoclonal antibodies b12, 4E10, and 2G12. Finally, cross-antagonism assays showed that Delta9-12a could use aplaviroc-bound CCR5 for entry. These studies indicate that increased dependence on the CCR5 NT represents a mechanism by which HIV envelopes acquire resistance to CCR5 antagonists and may have more general implications for mechanisms of drug resistance that arise in vivo. In addition, envelopes such as Delta9-12a may be useful for developing new entry inhibitors that target the interaction of gp120 and the CCR5 NT.\",\"The X4 Antagonist Concept Trial investigates the safety and antiviral activity of AMD11070, a potent inhibitor of X4-tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro in HIV-infected patients harboring X4-tropic virus. Patients enrolled in the study had an X4 virus population 2000 relative luminescence units (rlu; by the Monogram Trofile Assay) and an HIV-1 RNA level 5000 copies/mL. Patients received AMD11070 monotherapy for 10 days. Coreceptor tropism, plasma HIV-1 RNA level, and CD4 cell count were measured at study entry, on day 5, and on day 10. Daily predose and serial samples on the last day of treatment were obtained for determination of plasma AMD11070 concentration. Ten patients were given AMD11070 monotherapy (200 mg to 8 patients and 100 mg to 2 patients) twice daily for 10 days. The median baseline CD4 cell count was 160 cells/mm(3), and the median HIV-1 RNA level was 91,447 copies/mL. Four of 9 evaluable patients achieved a reduction in X4 virus population of >or= rlu. The median change in X4 virus population at the end of treatment was -0.22 log(10) rlu (range, -1.90 to 0.23 log(10) rlu). Three of 4 patients who responded to therapy showed a tropism shift from dual- or mixed-tropic viruses to exclusively R5 virus by day 10. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse events of greater than grade 2, or laboratory abnormalities. These results demonstrate the activity of AMD11070, the first oral CXCR4 antagonist, against X4-tropic HIV-1. The drug was well tolerated, with no serious safety concerns. AMD11070 is on clinical hold because of histologic changes to the liver observed in long-term animal studies; additional preclinical safety assessments are pending.\",\"In HIV-infected patients, DC are likely to interact with both cell-free HIV and HIV-infected cells. We were interested in investigating the mechanism of virus transmission occurring upon contact between HIV-1-infected cells and DC, as well as the consequences for HIV-1 Ag-presenting activity. By comparing mixed co-cultures with trans-well cultures, we observed that cell-to-cell contact strongly increased HIV-1 Env-mediated virion endocytosis in target DC. This endocytosis was independent of HIV-1 tropism, de novo infection, HIV-1 Env-CD4-dependent fusion, and immature DC activation/maturation. We also found that augmentation of HIV-1 endocytosis was closely correlated with strong, Env-dependent HIV-1 Ag presentation by DC. Our results provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the induction of the anti-HIV adaptive immune response.\",\"The delivery of therapeutic genes to the central nervous system (CNS) using viral vectors represents an appealing strategy for the treatment of nerve injury and disorders of the CNS. Important factors determining CNS targeting include tropism of the viral vectors and retrograde transport of the vector particles. Retrograde transport of equine anemia virus (EIAV)-based lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the glycoprotein derived from the Rabies virus RabERA strain from peripheral muscle to spinal motor neurons (MNs) was previously reported. Despite therapeutic effects achieved in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the efficiency of this approach needs to be improved for clinical translation. To date there has not been a quantitative assessment of pseudotyped HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors to transduce MNs. Here, we describe quantitative tests to analyze the retrograde transport capacity of HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the G glycoprotein derived from Rabies and Rabies-related viruses (Lyssaviruses). With a view toward optimizing the retrograde transport properties of HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors, we compared the glycoproteins from different enveloped viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family, genus Lyssavirus, and evaluated their ability to transduce specific cell populations and promote retrograde axonal transport. We first tested the transduction performance of these pseudotypes in vitro in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, NSC-34 neuroblastoma-spinal cord hybrid cells, and primary mixed spinal cord and pure astrocyte cultures. We then analyzed the uptake and retrograde transport of these pseudotyped vectors in vitro, using Campenot chambers. Finally, intraneural injections were performed to evaluate the in vivo retrograde axonal transport of these pseudotypes. Both the in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the glycoprotein derived from the Rabies virus PV strain possessed the best performance and neuronal tropism among the vectors tested. Our results indicate that HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the Rabies PV glycoprotein might provide important vehicles for CNS targeting by peripheral injection in the treatment of motor neuron diseases (MND), pain, and neuropathy.\",\"To compare the distribution of R5-like and X4-like HIV-1 envelope sequences in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). Clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 region was performed on PBMC DNA and plasma RNA of 11 HIV-1 subtype B-infected patients with high probability of carrying X4 virus. Coreceptor use was predicted using the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). A total of 330 and 427 clonal envelope sequences were obtained from PBMC and plasma, respectively. PSSM interpretation revealed the presence of a mixture of predicted X4 and R5 sequences in 10 patients and pure R5 sequences in 1. The X4 sequences were significantly more represented in PBMC (with an average of 52.2% of the clonal proviral sequences scored X4) compared with plasma (19.7% X4 sequences) (P < 0.0001). At the single patient level, the higher representation of X4 sequences in PBMC reached statistical significance (P < 0.002) in 6 individuals. Mixtures of X4 and R5 sequences with highly divergent PSSM scores are present in both plasma and PBMC, but a shift toward a more abundant representation of X4-like PSSM scores in PBMC-derived DNA was apparent. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of these findings with regard to tropism prediction and the use of CCR5 antagonists.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 R5 viruses vary extensively in phenotype. Thus, R5 envelopes (env) in the brain tissue of individuals with neurological complications are frequently highly macrophage-tropic. Macrophage tropism correlates with the capacity of the envelope to exploit low CD4 levels for infection. In addition, the presence of an asparagine at residue 283 within the CD4 binding site has been associated with brain-derived envelopes, increased env-CD4 affinity, and enhanced macrophage tropism. Here, we identify additional envelope determinants of R5 macrophage tropism. We compared highly macrophage-tropic (B33) and non-macrophage-tropic (LN40) envelopes from brain and lymph node specimens of one individual. We first examined the role of residue 283 in macrophage tropism. Introduction of N283 into LN40 (T283N) conferred efficient macrophage infectivity. In contrast, substitution of N283 for the more conserved threonine in B33 had little effect on macrophage infection. Thus, B33 carried determinants for macrophage tropism that were independent of N283. We prepared chimeric B33/LN40 envelopes and used site-directed mutagenesis to identify additional determinants. The determinants of macrophage tropism that were identified included residues on the CD4 binding loop flanks that were proximal to CD4 contact residues and residues in the V3 loop. The same residues affected sensitivity to CD4-immunoglobulin G inhibition, consistent with an altered env-CD4 affinity. We predict that these determinants alter exposure of CD4 contact residues. Moreover, the CD4 binding loop flanks are variable and may contribute to a general mechanism for protecting proximal CD4 contact residues from neutralizing antibodies. Our results have relevance for env-based vaccines that will need to expose critical CD4 contact residues to the immune system.\",\"In order to determine whether human prostate can be productively infected by HIV-1 strains with different tropism, and thus represent a potential source of HIV in semen, an organotypic culture of prostate from men undergoing prostatic adenomectomy for benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) was developed. The presence of potential HIV target cells in prostate tissues was investigated using immunohistochemistry. The infection of prostate explants following exposures with HIV-1 R5, R5X4 and X4 strains was analyzed through the measure of RT activity in culture supernatants, the quantification of HIV DNA in the explants and the detection of HIV RNA+ cells in situ. The overall prostate characteristics were retained for 21/2 weeks in culture. Numerous potential HIV-1 target cells were detected in the prostate stroma. Whilst HIV-1 R5SF162 strain consistently productively infected prostatic T lymphocytes and macrophages, the prototypic X4IIIB strain and a primary R5X4 strain showed less efficient replication in this organ. The BPH prostate is a site of HIV-1 R5 replication that could contribute virus to semen. A limited spreading of HIV-1 X4 and R5X4 in this organ could participate to the preferential sexual transmission of HIV-1 R5 strains.\",\"The signature for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neurovirulence remains a subject of intense debate. Macrophage viral tropism is one prerequisite but others, including virus-induced alterations in innate and adaptive immunity, remain under investigation. HIV-1-infected mononuclear phagocytes (MPs; perivascular macrophages and microglia) secrete toxins that affect neurons. The authors hypothesize that neurovirulent HIV-1 variants affect the MP proteome by inducing a signature of neurotoxic proteins and thus affect cognitive function. To test this hypothesis, HIV-1 isolates obtained from peripheral blood of women with normal cognition (NC) were compared to isolates obtained from women with cognitive impairment (CI) and to the laboratory adapted SF162, a spinal fluid R5 isolate from a patient with HIV-1-associated dementia. HIV-1 isolates were used to infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and infection monitored by secreted HIV-1 p24 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell lysates of uninfected and HIV-1-infected MDMs at 14 days post infection were fractionated by cationic exchange chromatography and analyzed by surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight (SELDI-TOF) using generalized estimating equations statistics. Proteins were separated by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D SDS-PAGE) and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of viral replication were similar amongst the HIV-1 isolates, although higher levels were obtained from one viral strain obtained from a patient with CI. Significant differences were found in protein profiles between virus-infected MDMs with NC, CI, and SF162 isolates (adjusted P value after multiple testing corrections, or q value <.10). The authors identified 6 unique proteins in NC, 7 in SF162, and 20 in CI. Three proteins were common to SF162 and CI strains. The MDM proteins linked to infection with CI strains were related to apoptosis, chemotaxis, inflammation, and redox metabolism. These findings support the hypothesis that the macrophage proteome differ when infected with viral isolates of women with and without CI.\",\"NaN\",\"During acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, high viral loads and the induction of host immune responses typically coincide with the onset of clinical symptoms. However, clinically severe presentations during acute HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection, including AIDS-defining symptoms, are unusual. Virus isolates were tested for clade, drug susceptibility, coreceptor use, and growth rate in 2 case reports of sexual transmission of HIV-1 infection. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype was determined, and HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to an overlapping peptide set spanning the entire HIV clade A and clade B proteome were assayed. The viruses isolated in the 2 unrelated case reports of severe primary HIV-1 infection showed R5/X4 dual-mixed tropism, belonged to clade B and CRF02-AG, and were highly replicative in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture. Impaired humoral responses were paralleled by a profound absence of HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to the entire viral proteome in the 2 case reports. In 1 case report for which the virus source was available, there was a remarkable HLA similarity between the 2 patients involved in the transmission event, because 3 of 4 HLA-A and HLA-B alleles had matched HLA supertype for both patients. The data suggest that concurrence of viral and host factors contributes to the clinical severity of primary HIV-1 infection and that patients infected with highly replicative, dual-tropic viruses are more prone to develop AIDS-defining symptoms during acute infection if they are unable to mount humoral and cellular HIV-1-specific immune responses. The presence of concordant HLA supertypes might facilitate the preferential transmission of HLA-adapted viral variants, further accelerating disease progression.\",\"The best hope of controlling the HIV pandemic is the development of an effective vaccine. In addition to the stimulation of virus neutralising antibodies, a vaccine will need an effective T-cell response against the virus. Vaccines based on recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) are promising candidates to stimulate anti-HIV T-cell responses. This review discusses the different rAd vector types, problems raised by host immune responses against them and strategies that are being adopted to overcome this problem. Vaccines need to target and stimulate dendritic cells and thus the tropism and interaction of rAd-based vaccines with these cells is covered. Different rAd vaccination regimes and the need to stimulate mucosal responses are discussed together with data from animal studies on immunogenicity and virus challenge experiments. The review ends with a discussion of the recent disappointing Merck HIV vaccine trial.\",\"Ibalizumab (formerly TNX-355) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CD4, the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and inhibits the viral entry process. A phase lb multidose study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of ibalizumab was conducted with 22 HIV-1-infected patients. Nineteen patients were randomized to receive either 10 mg/kg of body weight weekly (arm A) or a 10-mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks (arm B) intravenously for 9 weeks. Three patients were assigned to receive 25 mg/kg every 2 weeks for five doses (arm C). During the study, the patients remained off other antiretrovirals or continued a stable failing regimen. Treatment with ibalizumab resulted in substantial reductions in HIV-1 RNA levels (0.5 to 1.7 log(10)) in 20 of 22 subjects. In most patients, HIV-1 RNA fell to nadir levels after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment and then returned to baseline despite continued treatment. Baseline viral isolates were susceptible to ibalizumab in vitro, regardless of coreceptor tropism. Emerging resistance to ibalizumab was manifested by reduced maximal percent inhibition in a single-cycle HIV infectivity assay. Resistant isolates remained CD4 dependent and were susceptible to enfuvirtide in vitro. Complete coating of CD4(+) T-cell receptors was correlated with serum ibalizumab concentrations. There was no evidence of CD4(+) T-cell depletion in ibalizumab-treated patients. Ibalizumab was not immunogenic, and no serious drug-related adverse effects occurred. In conclusion, ibalizumab administered either weekly or biweekly was safe and well tolerated and demonstrated antiviral activity. Further studies with ibalizumab in combination with standard antiretroviral treatments are warranted.\",\"HIV-1 infects macrophages and microglia in the brain and can cause neurological disorders in infected patients. We and others have shown that brain-derived envelope glycoproteins (Env) have lower CD4 dependence and higher avidity for CD4 than those from peripheral isolates, and we have also observed increased fusogenicity and reduced sensitivity to the fusion inhibitor T-1249. Due to the genetic differences between brain and spleen env from one individual throughout gp120 and in gp41's heptad repeat 2 (HR2), we investigated the viral determinants for the phenotypic differences by performing functional studies with chimeric and mutant Env. Chimeric Env showed that the V1/V2-C2-V3 region in brain's gp120 determines the low CD4 dependence and high avidity for CD4, as well as macrophage tropism and reduced sensitivity to the small molecule BMS-378806. Changes in brain gp41's HR2 region did not contribute to the increased fusogenicity or to the reduced sensitivity to T-1249, since a T-1249-based peptide containing residues found in brain's but not in spleen's HR2 had similar potency than T-1249 and interacted similarly with an immobilized heptad repeat 1-derived peptide in surface plasmon resonance analysis. However, the increased fusogenicity and reduced T-1249 sensitivity of brain and certain chimeric Env mostly correlated with the low CD4 dependence and high avidity for CD4 determined by brain's V1-V3 region. Remarkably, most but not all of these low CD4-dependent, macrophage tropic envelopes glycoproteins also had increased sensitivity to the novel allosteric entry inhibitor HNG-105. The gp120's C2 region asparagine 283 (N283) has been previously associated with macrophage tropism, brain infection, lower CD4 dependence and higher CD4 affinity. Therefore, we introduced the N283T mutation into an env clone from a brain-derived isolate and into a brain tissue-derived env clone, and the T283N change into a spleen-derived env from the same individual; however, we found that their phenotypes were not affected. We have identified that the V1-V3 region of a brain-derived envelope glycoprotein seems to play a crucial role in determining not only the low CD4 dependence and increased macrophage tropism, but also the augmented fusogenicity and reduced sensitivity to T-1249 and BMS-378806. By contrast, increased sensitivity to HNG-105 mostly correlated with low CD4 dependence and macrophage tropism but was not determined by the presence of the brain's V1-V3 region, confirming that viral determinants of phenotypic changes in brain-derived envelope glycoproteins are likely complex and context-dependent.\",\"Worldwide, chronic viral infections cause major health problems with severe morbidity and mortality. HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) manifest themselves as persistent infections, but they are entirely distinct viruses with distinct replication mechanisms, tropism, and kinetics. Coinfections with HCV among people with HIV are emerging as a growing problem. Cellular immune responses play an important role in viral clearance and disease pathogenesis. However, cellular immunity to HIV and HCV is affected severely in chronic patients. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dysfunctional T cell response, including viral escape mutations, exhaustion of the T cell compartment, and the activity of regulatory T cells. Also, modulation of the function of dendritic cells (DC) has been suggested as one of the mechanisms used by persistent viruses to evade the immune system. In this review, we will focus on DC interactions with one murine persistent virus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13) and two human persistent viruses (HIV-1 and HCV), intending to examine if general strategies are used by persistent viruses to modulate the function of DC to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of viral persistence.\",\"We examined the emergence of CXCR4 (i.e., X4) tropism in 67 male human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who were selected to reflect the full spectrum of rates of HIV-1 disease progression. A mean of 10 serial samples per donor were evaluated by a laboratory-validated, commercially available assay to determine phenotypic coreceptor use. A total of 52% of men had dual- or mixed-tropic HIV-1 detected at 1 or more of the time points tested. Use of X4 by HIV-1 was detected more frequently among men who developed AIDS (defined as a CD4(+) T cell count of <200 cells/muL and/or an AIDS-defining illness) < or =11 years after seroconversion than among those who did not (P = .005), as well as among men who exhibited a total T cell count decline (i.e., a CD3(+) inflection point), compared with those who did not (P = .03). For men in whom both X4 virus and an inflection point were detected, emergence of X4 virus preceded the inflection point by a median of 0.83 years. The median CD4(+) T cell count at first detection of X4 viruses before the onset of AIDS was 475 cells/microL. We conclude that HIV-1 variants that used X4 frequently emerged at high CD4(+) T cell counts and may contribute to the decrease in T cell numbers during late HIV-1 infection.\",\"Replacing phenotypic assays with simple genotypic predictions of HIV-1 coreceptor usage would make the clinical use of CCR5 antagonists easier. Paired genotypic and phenotypic determination of HIV-1 coreceptor usage was performed to assess several genotypic approaches for detecting CXCR4-using and CCR5-using viruses in a clinical setting. HIV-1 coreceptor usage was prospectively assessed using plasma samples from 103 patients who were candidates for treatment with a CCR5 antagonist. Direct sequencing of the V3 region and a sensitive recombinant virus phenotypic entry assay were performed in parallel for each patient from the same bulk env PCR product. The 103 patients had a median CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 268 x 10(6)cells/l and nadirs of 98 x 10(6)cells/l. Paired genotypic and phenotypic data were obtained for 98 of the 103 patients. For detecting CXCR4-using viruses, the genotypic rule based on amino-acid residues at positions 11/25 and the overall net charge of V3 was 77% sensitive and 96% specific. The Geno2pheno bioinformatic tool was 88% sensitive and 87% specific. The WebPSSM tool prediction with the SI/NSI matrix was 77% sensitive and 94% specific. The global concordance between genotypic and phenotypic data was 91% with the rule combining the amino-acid residues at positions 11/25 and V3 net charge. Genotypic predictions performed well in paired genotypic and phenotypic assessment of HIV-1 coreceptor usage. Multicenter studies analyzing the correlations between the genotypic determination of HIV-1 tropism and clinical response to CCR5 antagonists are needed to validate this approach in clinical practice.\",\"We have assessed the potential of the fusion inhibitory peptide T-1249 for development as a vaginal microbicide to prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission. When formulated as a simple gel, T-1249 provided dose-dependent protection to macaques against high-dose challenge with three different SHIVs that used either CCR5 or CXCR4 for infection (the R5 virus SHIV-162P3, the X4 virus SHIV-KU1 and the R5X4 virus SHIV-89.6P), and it also protected against SIVmac251 (R5). Protection of half of the test animals was estimated by interpolation to occur at T-1249 concentrations of approximately 40-130 muM, whereas complete protection was observed at 0.1-2 mM. In vitro, T-1249 had substantial breadth of activity against HIV-1 strains from multiple genetic subtypes and in a coreceptor-independent manner. Thus, at 1 muM in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell-based replication assay, T-1249 inhibited all 29 R5 viruses, all 12 X4 viruses and all 7 R5X4 viruses in the test panel, irrespective of their genetic subtype. Combining lower concentrations of T-1249 with other entry inhibitors (CMPD-167, BMS-C, or AMD3465) increased the proportion of test viruses that could be blocked. In the PhenoSense assay, T-1249 was active against 636 different HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped viruses of varying tropism and derived from clinical samples, with IC(50) values typically clustered in a 10-fold range approximately 10 nM. Overall, these results support the concept of using T-1249 as a component of an entry inhibitor-based combination microbicide to prevent the sexual transmission of diverse HIV-1 variants.\",\"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1 variants are thought to be less fit than wild-type virus. In 2005, we reported a case of transmitted MDR HIV-1 infection associated with dual tropism and rapid clinical progression. Here we report the in vitro characterization of the virus isolates. Replication characteristics of bulk and clonal isolates from this case (MDR-1) were examined and compared with these of a panel of transmitted MDR and wild-type (WT) viruses (MDR-2 approximately 4, WT-1, 2). Infectivity and frequency of infectious virion of propagated isolates were high in MDR-1 biological clones (mean titer, 3.5 x 10(5) TCID50/mL; mean frequency of infectious virion, 1/2444) and its bulk isolate (3.2 x 10(6) TCID50/mL; 1/301) as compared with the other biological clones (7.3 x 10(3) TCID50/mL; 1/21,320). Upslope (log10 p24/mL/d) of viral replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture was much higher in MDR-1 clones (1.30 +/- 0.30: mean +/- SD) than those of MDR-2 approximately 4 (0.75 +/- 0.08) or WT-1, WT-2 clones (0.82 +/- 0.03). The bulk isolate and dual-tropic biological clones from MDR-1 depleted CD4+ T cells very rapidly in vitro compared with the other viruses tested. These findings support the hypothesis that MDR HIV-1 can effectively evolve and compensate not only to retain high-level replication but also to exhibit virulence associated with rapid disease progression.\",\"HIV-1 utilizes CD4 and either chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) or chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) to gain entry into host cells. Small molecule CCR5 antagonists are currently being developed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Because HIV-1 may also use CXCR4 for entry, the use of CCR5 entry inhibitors is controversial for patients harboring CCR5-using and CXCR4-using (dual/mixed-tropic) viruses. The goal of the present study was to determine the proportion of CCR5-tropic and CXCR4-tropic viruses in dual/mixed-tropic virus isolates from drug-na\\u00efve patients and the phenotypic and genotypic relationships of viruses that use CCR5 or CXCR4 or both. Fourteen antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients were identified as having population coreceptor tropism readout of dual/mixed-tropic viruses. Intrapatient comparisons of coreceptor tropism and genotype of env clones were conducted on plasma virus from each patient. Population HIV-1 envelope tropism and susceptibility to the CCR5 entry inhibitor, aplaviroc, were performed using the Monogram Biosciences Trofile Assay. Twelve env clones from each patient were analyzed for coreceptor tropism, aplaviroc sensitivity, genotype, and intrapatient phylogenetic relationships. Viral populations from antiretroviral-naive patients with dual/mixed-tropic virus are composed primarily of CCR5-tropic env clones mixed with those that use both coreceptors (R5X4-tropic) and, occasionally, CXCR4-tropic env clones. Interestingly, the efficiency of CXCR4 use by R5X4-tropic env clones varied with their genetic relationships to CCR5-tropic env clones from the same patient. These data show that the majority of viruses in these dual/mixed-tropic populations use CCR5 and suggest that antiretroviral-naive patients may benefit from combination therapy that includes CCR5 entry inhibitors.\",\"TRIM5 alpha is a restriction factor that interferes with retroviral infections in a species-specific manner in primate cells. Although TRIM5 alpha is constitutively expressed, its expression has been shown to be up-regulated by type I interferon (IFN). Among primates, a particular case exists in owl monkey cells, which express a fusion protein between TRIM5 and cyclophilin A, TRIMCyp, specifically interfering with HIV-1 infection. No studies have been conducted so far concerning the possible induction of TRIMCyp by IFN. We investigated the consequences of IFN treatment on retroviral restriction in diverse primate cells and evaluated the implication of TRIM5 alpha or TRIMCyp in IFN-induced anti-retroviral activities. First, we show that human type I IFN can enhance TRIM5 alpha expression in human, African green monkey and macaque cells, as well as TRIMCyp expression in owl monkey cells. In TRIM5 alpha-expressing primate cell lines, type I IFN has little or no effect on HIV-1 infection, whereas it potentiates restriction activity against N-MLV in human and African green monkey cells. In contrast, type I IFN treatment of owl monkey cells induces a great enhancement of HIV-1 restriction, as well as a strain-tropism independent restriction of MLV. We were able to demonstrate that TRIM5 alpha is the main mediator of the IFN-induced activity against N-MLV in human and African green monkey cells, whereas TRIMCyp mediates the IFN-induced HIV-1 restriction enhancement in owl monkey cells. In contrast, the type I IFN-induced anti-MLV restriction in owl monkey cells is independent of TRIMCyp expression. Together, our observations indicate that both TRIM5 alpha and TRIMCyp are implicated in IFN-induced anti-retroviral response in primate cells. Furthermore, we found that type I IFN also induces a TRIMCyp-independent restriction activity specific to MLV in owl monkey cells.\",\"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) are major producers of type I interferons (IFN) in response to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. To better define the underlying mechanisms, we studied the magnitude of alpha IFN (IFN-alpha) induction by recombinant viruses containing changes in the Env protein that impair or disrupt CD4 binding or expressing primary env alleles with differential coreceptor tropism. We found that the CD4 binding affinity but not the viral coreceptor usage is critical for the attachment of autofluorescing HIV-1 to PDC and for subsequent IFN-alpha induction. Our results illustrate the importance of the gp120-CD4 interaction in determining HIV-1-induced immune stimulation via IFN-alpha production.\",\"Viral replication requires the help of host cell factors, whose species specificity may affect viral tropism. On the other hand, there exist host factors that restrict viral replication. The anti-viral system mediated by some of these restriction factors, which is termed intrinsic immunity and is distinguished from conventional innate and adaptive immunity, has been described as playing an important role in making species-specific barriers against viral infection. Here, we describe the current progress in understanding of such restriction factors against retroviral replication, focusing on TRIM5alpha and APOBEC, whose anti-retroviral effects have recently been recognized. Additionally, we mention cyclophilin A, which is essential for HIV-1 replication in human cells and may affect viral tropism. Understanding of these host factors would contribute to identification of the determinants for viral tropism.\",\"Pure X4 and X4R5 dual-tropic viruses may be recognized in approximately 15% of drug-naive HIV-1-positive patients. CCR5 antagonists are active against R5 viruses; therefore, HIV tropism should be known before their prescription. A population-based phenotypic assay was performed in 61 recent HIV-1 seroconverters. The results were compared with those obtained using 8 different predictor software programs (C4.5, C4.5 with 8 and 12, PART, SVM, Charge Rule, PSSMsinsi, PSSMx4r5, and geno2pheno), which are freely available at 3 different Web sites and use V3 sequences derived from patient's viruses. Phenotypic testing reported X4R5 dual-tropic viruses in 10 (16.4%) patients. CD4 cell counts and viral loads were significantly lower in X4R5 dual-tropic (450 cells/microL and 3.9 log HIV RNA copies/mL) than in R5 viruses (629 cells/microL, 4.5 log HIV RNA copies/mL) (P<0.05). The overall concordance of genotype and phenotype was relatively good (>80%). Although specificity was >90% using all but 1 genotypic predictor (geno2pheno), however, the sensitivity for the detection of X4 variants was low (<30%), except for SVM and geno2pheno (70%). The prevalence of X4 and X4/R5 dual-tropic viruses in recent HIV seroconverters is 16%. Current genotypic algorithms need to be improved for the estimation of HIV-1 coreceptor use before moving to the clinic. This information is crucial for the selection of candidates to receive CCR5 antagonists in places where phenotypic tropism assays may not be feasible.\",\"Maraviroc is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug from a new class of antiretroviral agents that targets a host protein, the chemokine receptor CCR5, rather than a viral target. Binding of maraviroc to this cell-surface protein results in blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) attachment to the coreceptor and prevents the virus from entering CD4+ cells. In this review, we include the details of the discoveries that led to the development of this drug. The drug's pharmacology, including pharmacokinetics and drug interactions, is discussed, as are the clinical efficacy studies that led to licensure. HIV-1 mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc, assays to determine viral coreceptor use (tropism), drug safety, and clinical use of maraviroc are discussed at length.\",\"Here, we investigated the pre-steady-state deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) incorporation kinetics of primate foamy virus (PFV) reverse transcriptase (RT) in comparison with those of HIV-1 and MuLV RTs. PFV RT displayed a drastic reduction in primer extension at low dNTP concentrations where HIV-1 RT remains highly active, indicating a low dNTP binding affinity in the case of PFV RT. Indeed, kinetic analysis showed that, as observed with MuLV RT, PFV RT exhibits approximately 10 to 80 times lower dNTP binding affinity than HIV-1 RT. These three RTs, however, show similar catalytic activities. In conclusion, PFV RT displays mechanistic distinctions in comparison to HIV-1 RT and shares close similarity to MuLV RT.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may utilize the CXCR4 coreceptor (X4 virus), the CCR5 coreceptor (R5 virus), or both (dual/mixed [DM] virus). We analyzed HIV-1 coreceptor tropism in Ugandan infants enrolled in the HIVNET (HIV Network for Prevention Trials) 012 trial. Plasma or serum was analyzed using a commercial coreceptor tropism assay. HIV env subtype was determined by phylogenetic methods. Tropism results were obtained for 57 samples from infants collected 6-14 weeks after birth. Fifty-two infants had only R5 virus, and 5 had either X4 or DM virus. The mothers of those 5 infants also had X4 or DM virus. In infants, subtype D infection was associated with high-level infectivity in CCR5-bearing cells and also with the detection of X4 or DM strains. High-level infectivity in CCR5-bearing cells was associated with decreased infant survival, but infection with X4 or DM virus was not. HIV clones from infants with DM viral populations showed different patterns of coreceptor use. V3 loop sequence-based algorithms predicted the tropism of some, but not all, env clones. Complex patterns of HIV tropism were found in HIV-infected newborn infants. Subtype D infection was associated with X4 virus and with high-level replication in CCR5-bearing cells. High-level replication of R5 virus was associated with decreased infant survival.\",\"In a phase I/II evaluation of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, human immunodeficiency virus RNA levels were significantly reduced in a single study subject who harbored CXCR4 (X4)-tropic virus, but not in subjects who harbored either dual/mixed (DM)-tropic or CCR5 (R5)-tropic virus (C. W. Hendrix et al., J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 37:1253-1262, 2004). In this study, we analyzed the envelope clones of DM-tropic virus in baseline and treated virus populations from 14 subjects. Ten subjects exhibited significant reductions in CXCR4-mediated infectivity after 10 days of AMD3100 therapy relative to baseline (X4 suppressor group), while four subjects had no reduction of CXCR4-mediated infectivity (X4 nonsuppressor group). The baseline viruses of the X4 suppressor group infected CXCR4-expressing cells less efficiently than those of the X4 nonsuppressor group. Clonal analysis indicated that the baseline viruses from the X4 suppressor group contained a higher proportion of R5-tropic variants mixed with CXCR4-using variants, while the X4 nonsuppressor group was enriched for CXCR4-using variants. AMD3100 suppressed X4-tropic variants in all subjects studied, but not all dualtropic variants. Furthermore, dualtropic variants that used CXCR4 efficiently were suppressed by AMD3100, while dualtropic variants that used CXCR4 poorly were not. This study demonstrated that AMD3100 has the ability to suppress both X4-tropic and certain dualtropic variants in vivo. The suppression of CXCR4-using variants by AMD3100 is dependent on both the tropism composition of the virus population and the efficiency of CXCR4 usage of individual variants.\",\"Many studies have demonstrated that the third variable region (V3) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein (Env) is a major determinant of coreceptor tropism. Other regions in the surface gp120 subunit of Env can modulate coreceptor tropism in a manner that is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of env determinants outside of V3 on coreceptor usage through the analysis of (i) patient-derived env clones that differ in coreceptor tropism, (ii) chimeric env sequences, and (iii) site-directed mutants. The introduction of distinct V3 sequences from CXCR4-using clones into an R5-tropic env backbone conferred the inefficient use of CXCR4 in some but not all cases. Conversely, in many cases, X4- and dual-tropic env backbones containing the V3 sequences of R5-tropic clones retained the ability to use CXCR4, suggesting that sequences outside of the V3 regions of these CXCR4-using clones were responsible for CXCR4 use. The determinants of CXCR4 use in a set of dual-tropic env sequences with V3 sequences identical to those of R5-tropic clones mapped to the gp41 transmembrane (TM) subunit. In one case, a single-amino-acid substitution in the fusion peptide of TM was able to confer CXCR4 use; however, TM substitutions associated with CXCR4 use varied among different env sequences. These results demonstrate that sequences in TM can modulate coreceptor specificity and that env sequences other than that of V3 may facilitate efficient CXCR4-mediated entry. We hypothesize that the latter plays an important role in the transition from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor use.\",\"During HIV-1 infection, distinct biological phenotypes are observed between R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains with respect to pathogenicity and tropism. In this study, temporal changes of the expression levels of the complete human transcriptome, representing 47,000 well-characterized human transcripts, were monitored in the first 24 h during HIV-1 R5 and X4 exposition in resting primary CD4(+) T cells. We provide evidence that R5 viruses modulate, to a greater extent than X4 viruses, the level of mRNA of the resting CD4(+) T cells. Indeed, modulation of the TCR signaling and the actin organization involving the WAVE/ABI complex and the ARP2/3 complex appeared to be associated with R5 exposition. The data suggest that the ability of R5 viruses to modulate TCR-mediated actin polymerization and signaling creates a favorable environment for CD4(+) T cell activation after TCR stimulation and may partly explain why R5 is the primary strain observed early in the natural infection process.\",\"Numerous studies have shown that viral quasi-species with genetically diverse envelope proteins (Env) replicate simultaneously in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Less information is available concerning the extent that envelope sequence diversity translates into a diversity of phenotypic properties, including infectivity and resistance to entry inhibitors. To study these questions, we isolated genetically distinct contemporaneous clonal viral populations from the plasma of 5 HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 70), and evaluated the infectivity of recombinant viruses expressing Env proteins from the clonal viruses in several target cells. The sensitivity to entry inhibitors (enfuvirtide, TAK-799), soluble CD4 and monoclonal antibodies (2G12, 48d, 2F5) was also evaluated for a subset of the recombinant viruses (n = 20). Even when comparisons were restricted to viruses with similar tropism, the infectivity for a given target cell of viruses carrying different Env proteins from the same patient varied over an approximately 10-fold range, and differences in their relative ability to infect different target cells were also observed. Variable region haplotypes associated with high and low infectivity could be identified for one patient. In addition, clones carrying unique mutations in V3 often displayed low infectivity. No correlation was observed between viral infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition by any of the six entry inhibitors evaluated, indicating that these properties can be dissociated. Significant inter-patient differences, independent of infectivity, were observed for the sensitivity of Env proteins to several entry inhibitors and their ability to infect different target cells. These findings demonstrate the marked functional heterogeneity of HIV-1 Env proteins expressed by contemporaneous circulating viruses, and underscore the advantage of clonal analyses in characterizing the spectrum of functional properties of the genetically diverse viral populations present in a given patient.\",\"The V1/V2 domain of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein has been shown to contribute to viral cell tropism during infection and also to viral recognition by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. However, this domain has been poorly investigated. Carbohydrates have been demonstrated to dramatically influence immune reactivity of antisera to viral glycoprotein antigens. In this study, DNA sequences coding for V1/V2 domains from HIV-1 primary isolates of three subtypes (A, B, and C) were subcloned into a secretion vector and used to transfect CHO cells that are able to achieve the glycosylation of proteins. The structure of purified recombinant V1/V2 proteins was tested using two anti-V1/V2 monoclonal antibodies directed against either a linear or a conformational and glycosylation-dependent epitope (8.22.2 and 697-D). Serum or saliva of 14/82 seropositive patients with anti-V1/V2 reactivity demonstrated good recognition of the recombinant proteins. Deglycosylation of the recombinant proteins was found to increase the reactivity of the serum IgG to the clade A and C but not to clade B V1/V2 domain demonstrating that the recognition of glycosylation sites by serum IgG is clade dependent. When considering SIgA from parotid saliva, deglycosylation of all recombinant proteins tested decreased the reactivity, suggesting that glycosylation plays an important role in the recognition of V1/V2 domain target epitopes by this class of antibodies. In conclusion, these results suggest the influence of carbohydrate moieties on the specificity of the antibodies to the V1/V2 domain produced during HIV infection and the potential importance of viral glycans in vaccine responses after mucosal administration.\",\"The transduction efficiency and cell tropism of viral vectors rAAV2/1, rAAV2, Ad5, Ad5/F35, and Lentivirus were evaluated in retina. All viral vectors achieved efficient transduction in living rat retina. However, each vector showed distinctive efficiency in vitro especially for rAAV2/1, which displayed poor transduction in cultured retinal cells. Distinctive cell-specific GFP expression was observed in vivo and in vitro for the same viral vector. The cell-specific tropism was not strictly correlated with the correspondent distribution of viral receptors in retina. These results provided important insights into the selection of appropriate vectors when specific retinal diseases are considered for gene therapy.\",\"HIV-1 R5 viruses cause most of the AIDS cases worldwide and are preferentially transmitted compared to CXCR4-using viruses. Furthermore, R5 viruses vary extensively in capacity to infect macrophages and highly macrophage-tropic variants are frequently identified in the brains of patients with dementia. Here, we investigated the sensitivity of R5 envelopes to a range of inhibitors and antibodies that block HIV entry. We studied a large panel of R5 envelopes, derived by PCR amplification without culture from brain, lymph node, blood and semen. These R5 envelopes conferred a wide range of macrophage tropism and included highly macrophage-tropic variants from brain and non-macrophage-tropic variants from lymph node. R5 macrophage-tropism correlated with sensitivity to inhibition by reagents that inhibited gp120:CD4 interactions. Thus, increasing macrophage-tropism was associated with increased sensitivity to soluble CD4 and to IgG-CD4 (PRO 542), but with increased resistance to the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mab), Q4120. These observations were highly significant and are consistent with an increased affinity of envelope for CD4 for macrophage-tropic envelopes. No overall correlations were noted between R5 macrophage-tropism and sensitivity to CCR5 antagonists or to gp41 specific reagents. Intriguingly, there was a relationship between increasing macrophage-tropism and increased sensitivity to the CD4 binding site mab, b12, but decreased sensitivity to 2G12, a mab that binds a glycan complex on gp120. Variation in R5 macrophage-tropism is caused by envelope variation that predominantly influences sensitivity to reagents that block gp120:CD4 interactions. Such variation has important implications for therapy using viral entry inhibitors and for the design of envelope antigens for vaccines.\",\"One or both of two co-receptors, CCR5 (R5) and CXCR4 (X4), are used by HIV-1 to enter into host cells. The glycoprotein 120 (gp120) V3 sequence is correlated with the R5 and X4 phenotype. CCR5 inhibitors are specifically active against R5 viruses, suggesting the need to determine tropism before the use of these antagonists. A comparison of the position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) and Geno2pheno algorithms based on the V3 loop gp120 sequences and previously described to be correlated to the R5 or X4 phenotype was carried out. V3 envelope (env) genes from 83 plasma samples were amplified and sequenced, and 69 sequences were analysed with the PSSM and Geno2pheno algorithms. These two algorithms were concordant in 86.5% of cases. The Geno2pheno algorithm gave a tropism result more frequently than the PSSM algorithm, but R5X4 or X4 viruses were less frequently detected by the Geno2pheno algorithm. R5X4 or X4 tropism was predicted in 29.9% of samples. There was more R5X4 co-receptor use in the antiretroviral-treated group than in the antiretroviral-na\\u00efve group. It is advisable to run a validated co-receptor use prediction tool before using co-receptor antagonists. If genotyping methods are considered, the PSSM and Geno2pheno algorithms are complementary and both are necessary. The association between predicted co-receptor use and virological response to co-receptor antagonists needs to be thoroughly evaluated.\",\"Recent studies have shown that blood monocytes harbor human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants that are genotypically distinguishable from those in CD4(+) T cells. However, the biological function of monocyte-derived HIV-1 remains unclear. Using pseudovirus assay, we analyzed the phenotype conferred by monocyte-derived HIV-1 envelopes from 8 patients. All pseudoviruses carrying monocyte-derived HIV-1 envelopes used CCR5; however, their use of additional coreceptors delineated 4 phenotypes in which viruses used (1) CCR5 only, (2) CCR5 and CXCR4, (3) CCR3 and CCR5, or (4) multiple coreceptors, including CCR1, CCR3, GPR15, CCR5, and CXCR4. More importantly, we observed 2 distinct cell tropism phenotypes for pseudoviruses carrying monocyte-derived envelopes: (1) monocyte-derived, macrophage-specific R5 (MDMS-R5) virus that, using CCR5 only, could infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) but not CD4(+) T cells and (2) dual tropic virus that infected both MDMs and primary CD4(+) T cells. We found blood monocytes harboring viruses with multiple phenotypes as early as 25 days before seroconversion and as late as 9 years after seroconversion. These data suggest that HIV-1 circulating in blood monocytes represents diverse HIV-1 with multiple phenotypes and that MDMS-R5 viruses may play an important role in infection with and persistence of HIV-1 within the monocyte/macrophage lineage.\",\"To investigate the immunological and virological factors that may lead to different patterns of disease progression characteristic of HIV-1-infected children, two HIV-1-infected siblings, a slow and a fast progressor, were followed prospectively before the onset of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Viral coreceptor usage, including the use of CCR5/CXCR4 chimeric receptors, macrophage tropism, and sensitivity to the CC-chemokine RANTES, has been studied. An autologous and heterologous neutralizing antibody response has been documented using peripheral blood mononuclear cells- and GHOST(3) cell line-based assays. Viral evolution was investigated by env C2-V3 region sequence analysis. Although both siblings were infected with HIV-1 of the R5 phenotype, their viruses showed important biological differences. In the fast progressor there was a higher RANTES sensitivity of the early virus, an increased trend to change the mode of CCR5 receptor use, and a larger genetic evolution. Both children developed an autologous neutralizing antibody response starting from the second year with evidence of the continuous emergence of resistant variants. A marked viral genetic and phenotypic evolution was documented in the fast progressor sibling, which is accompanied by a high viral RANTES sensitivity and persistent neutralizing antibodies.\",\"HIV-1 infection is characterized by a progressive decline of CD4 cell count, the underlying mechanisms of which are still debated. We recently found that during HIV-1 infection, CD4 T cells overexpress a ligand of the NK activating receptor NKp44 (NKp44L) and are sensitized to NK cytolytic activity. The expression of NKp44L is triggered by a highly conserved motif of gp41 (3S) and is inhibited by anti-3S antibodies. To assess whether viral tropism can affect NKp44L expression, NK cytotoxicity, and anti-3S antibodies production, 10 macaques were infected either with the CCR5 tropic SHIV162P3 or with a CXCR4/CCR5 dual-tropic SHIV89.6P. In SHIV162P3-infected macaques, expression of NKp44L was inversely correlated with anti-3S antibodies, in relation to CD4 depletion and NK cytotoxicity. By contrast, no such correlation was found in macaques infected with SHIV89.6P which, induced a rapid decline of CD4 T cells. These results highlight the key role played by NK cells in CD4 cell count decline with respect to coreceptor usage, and provided the setting to investigate new strategies for preventive and/or therapeutic immunization to stimulate anti-3S antibodies.\",\"As immune recovery during HAART is mainly caused by the expansion of X4-naive cells, we studied the evolution of HIV tropism in the reservoir of 34 patients receiving 48 weeks of HAART. No change in virus tropism was observed over time, but patients with X4 viruses had higher HIV-1 proviral DNA levels than patients with R5 viruses. This suggests that CCR5 antagonist activity should not be compromised in patients harbouring R5 viruses before starting HAART.\",\"(1) Maraviroc belongs to a new class of antiretroviral drugs designed to block entry of HIV-1 into CD4+ T-cells via the CCR5 coreceptor. It is indicated for combination therapy in treatment-experienced adults infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 that is resistant to multiple antiretroviral agents. (2) Results from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that in treatment experienced patients, maraviroc, combined with optimized background therapy (OBT), significantly decreases the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (viral load) when compared with OBT alone. The number of patients achieving undetectable viral loads and CD4+ cell count increases were also significantly higher in those receiving maraviroc. (3) Most patients experiencing treatment failure with maraviroc exhibit tropism changes from CCR5-tropic to CXCR4-using virus, but there is no evidence of disease progression. (4) Adverse effects reported with maraviroc include cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, muscle and joint pain, abdominal pain, and postural hypotension (dizziness). No significant increases in cardiovascular events, hepatotoxicity, infections or malignancies have been reported with short-term maraviroc therapy. Several post-marketing studies will assess maraviroc's long-term safety for immune function, liver function, malignancy, cardiac events, and risks associated with changes in tropism. (5) Results from an ongoing trial in treatment naive patients suggest that maraviroc may not be superior in terms of viral suppression to standard therapy, but may significantly increase the number of CD4+ T-cells.\",\"Viral tropism plays a major role in HIV pathogenesis and may influence the activity of entry inhibitors. The impact of antiretroviral therapy use on the dynamics of viral tropism over time is still poorly understood. HIV co-receptor usage was determined longitudinally for over 5 years in 237 plasma specimens collected from 73 distinct HIV-1-infected drug-naive individuals, 42 of whom initiated antiretroviral therapy thereafter and 31 who remained untreated. Viral tropism was estimated genotypically using the phenotype predictor software webPSSM, considering as X4 virus populations those with pure X4 and dual/mixed X4/R5 variants. At baseline, the prevalence of X4 viruses was 3.2% and 14.6% in patients who remained untreated and in those who initiated antiretroviral therapy, respectively (P = 0.112). Mean plasma HIV-RNA was lower in the former compared with the latter (3.8 +/- 0.9 versus 4.5 +/- 0.9 log; P < 0.004), while conversely the mean CD4 count was greater in untreated than in those who had begun therapy (536 +/- 191 versus 278 +/- 192 cells/mm3; P < 0.001). During follow-up, switch in co-receptor use occurred overall in 26% of the study population, with no significant differences between the groups. Emergence of X4 viruses was significantly associated with lower CD4 counts regardless of antiretroviral treatment exposure. The use of antiretroviral therapy does not seem to influence the selection of X4 viruses, which mainly occur in patients with low CD4 counts.\",\"RNAi is a useful tool for functional analysis of genes and developing a potential therapeutic strategy for various diseases including cancers. RNAi can be applied in various forms. HIV vectors are useful for the stable transduction of genes to both replicating and quiescent cells with a broad host tropism, and have been developed for basic and clinical research of gene therapy. HIV vectors can deliver shRNAs for post-transcriptional silencing of specific genes with high efficiency, and have been used to evaluate various genes for their potential involvement in cancer development and malignant features, and may be useful for future cancer gene therapy. Here we describe the development of shRNA-expressing HIV vectors and their use in cancer research, as well as perspectives for their future use in cancer gene therapy.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals frequently suffer from progressive encephelopathy, which is characterized by sensory neuropathy, sensory myelopathy, and dementia. Our group and others have reported the presence of highly macrophage-tropic R5 variants of HIV-1 in brain tissue of patients with neurological complications. These variants are able to exploit low amounts of CD4 and/or CCR5 for infection and potentially confer an expanded tropism for any cell types that express low CD4 and/or CCR5. In contrast to the brain-derived envelopes, we found that envelopes from lymph node tissue, blood, or semen were predominantly non-macrophage-tropic and required high amounts of CD4 for infection. Nevertheless, where tested, the non-macrophage-tropic envelopes conferred efficient replication in primary CD4(+) T-cell cultures. Determinants of R5 macrophage tropism appear to involve changes in the CD4 binding site, although further unknown determinants are also involved. The variation of R5 envelopes also affects their sensitivity to inhibition by ligands and entry inhibitors that target CD4 and CCR5. In summary, HIV-1 R5 viruses vary extensively in macrophage tropism. In the brain, highly macrophage-tropic variants may represent neurotropic or neurovirulent viruses. In addition, variation in R5 macrophage tropism may also have implications (1) for transmission, depending on what role macrophages or cells that express low CD4 and/or CCR5 play in the establishment of infection in a new host, and (2) for pathogenesis and depletion of CD4(+) T cells (i.e., do highly macrophage-tropic variants confer a broader tropism among CD4(+) T-cell populations late in disease and contribute to their depletion?).\",\"Several subtypes of HIV-1 circulate in infected people worldwide, including subtype B in the United States and subtype C in Africa and India. To understand the biological properties of HIV-1 subtype C, including cellular tropism, virus entry, replication efficiency and cytopathic effects, we reciprocally inserted our previously characterized envelope V3-V5 regions derived from 9 subtype C infected patients from India into a subtype B molecular clone, pNL4-3. Equal amounts of the chimeric viruses were used to infect T-lymphocyte cell lines (A3.01 and MT-2), coreceptor cell lines (U373-MAGI-CCR5/CXCR4), primary blood T-lymphocytes (PBL) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We found that subtype C envelope V3-V5 region chimeras failed to replicate in T-lymphocyte cell lines but replicated in PBL and MDM. In addition, these chimeras were able to infect U373MAGI-CD4+-CCR5+ but not U373MAGI-CD4+-CXCR4+ cell line, suggesting CCR5 coreceptor utilization and R5 phenotypes. These subtype C chimeras were unable to induce syncytia in MT-2 cells, indicative of non-syncytium inducing (NSI) phenotypes. More importantly, the subtype C envelope chimeras replicated at higher levels in PBL and MDM compared with subtype B chimeras and isolates. Furthermore, the higher levels subtype C chimeras replication in PBL and MDM correlated with increased virus entry in U373MAGI-CD4+-CCR5+. Taken together, these results suggest that the envelope V3 to V5 regions of subtype C contributed to higher levels of HIV-1 replication compared with subtype B chimeras, which may contribute to higher viral loads and faster disease progression in subtype C infected individuals than other subtypes as well as rapid HIV-1 subtype C spread in India.\",\"In the last 10 years HIV-1/human T-cell leukemia virus (HIV-1/HTLV) coinfection has emerged as a worldwide health problem. The numbers of HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfections in South America and Africa are increasing, as well as HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfections in the USA and Europe. Coinfections by either HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 and HIV-1 frequently occur in persons with a history of injection drug use. Since HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4+ T-cells and HTLV-2 has a tropism for CD8+ T-cells, the influence of coinfection on HIV-1 disease progression may be different. The effect of HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection on HIV-I pathogenesis is controversial as soluble factors produced by HTLV-1 infected cells can either enhance or suppress HIV-1 infection. In HTLV-1/HIV-1 coinfected patients, upregulation of HIV-1 expression was attributed to strong activation of cytokines that promoted HIV infection. The introduction of HAART has dramatically reduced HIV-1 morbidity and mortality, but has given rise to an increased number of inflammatory syndromes. While HAART is successful for controlling HIV disease, it has little impact on HTLV-1/2 genome expression. The consequence of coinfection, even with HAART, may well be the reported increase in neurologic disease. Several epidemiologic and in vitro studies of the influence of HTLV infection on HIV-1 related AIDS progression suggest that HTLV-1 infection can promote HIV-1 replication and accelerate the clinical progression to AIDS. However, other studies have not confirmed these observations. The differences in study outcomes could be related to the occurrence of different HIV-1 phenotypes in clinical disease. In contrast, evidence points to a confirmed protective role of HTLV-2 that is manifested as improved survival and delayed progression to AIDS. The protective effect may be the result of maintaining normal-range levels of CD4 and CD8 counts, lowering HIV replication, and immune activation. As a corollary, the number of long-term nonprogressors for AIDS in the HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfected group was found to be significantly higher than in HIV-1 monoinfected cases. Investigations of the natural factors induced by HTLV-2 that influence HIV-1 replication show that CCL3L1 (an isoform of CCL3) is preferentially induced in HTLV-2 exposed seronegative HIV individuals and in long-term nonprogressor HTLV-2/HIV-1 coinfected persons. The CCL3L 1 inhibits HIV replication and thus acts as a potent effector against both HIV infection and disease progression. As a complement to upregulation of CCL3L1, other chemokines and cytokines induced by HTLV-2 may contribute to induction of the Th1 response against invading pathogens, in contrast to the dominant Th2 response that appears to favor HIV infection. The number of individuals with either single HIV-1 or HTLV-2 infection, in a cohort of Italian intravenous drug users monitored for 20 years, decreased significantly over time. However, the magnitude of HTLV-2 decrease was significantly less than that of HIV-1, pointing to the need for increased attention to, and control of, HTLV infection. In conclusion, the long-term effects of HIV and HTLV coinfections are poorly understood and the mechanisms of dysregulation of cellular biosynthesis by HTLV that impact HIV disease progression remain elusive.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) V3 loop is critical for coreceptor binding and principally determines tropism for the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors. The recent crystallographic resolution of V3 shows that its base is closely associated with the conserved coreceptor binding site on the gp120 core, whereas more distal regions protrude toward the cell surface, likely mediating interactions with coreceptor extracellular loops. However, these V3-coreceptor interactions and the structural basis for CCR5 or CXCR4 specificity are poorly understood. Using the dual-tropic virus HIV-1(R3A), which uses both CCR5 and CXCR4, we sought to identify subdomains within V3 that selectively mediate R5 or X4 tropism. An extensive panel of V3 mutants was evaluated for effects on tropism and sensitivity to coreceptor antagonists. Mutations on either side of the V3 base (residues 3 to 8 and 26 to 33) ablated R5 tropism and made the resulting X4-tropic Envs more sensitive to the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100. When mutations were introduced within the V3 stem, only a deletion of residues 9 to 12 on the N-terminal side ablated X4 tropism. Remarkably, this R5-tropic Delta9-12 mutant was completely resistant to several small-molecule inhibitors of CCR5. Envs with mutations in the V3 crown (residues 13 to 20) remained dual tropic. Similar observations were made for a second dual-tropic isolate, HIV-1(89.6). These findings suggest that V3 subdomains can be identified that differentially affect R5 and X4 tropism and modulate sensitivity to CCR5 and CXCR4 inhibitors. These studies provide a novel approach for probing V3-coreceptor interactions and mechanisms by which these interactions can be inhibited.\",\"The inability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) to replicate in rhesus macaque cells is in part due to the failure of HIV-1 Vif to counteract the restriction factor APOBEC3G. However, in this study we demonstrate that several rhesus macaque APOBEC3 (rhAPOBEC3) proteins are capable of inhibiting HIV-1 infectivity. There was considerable variation in the ability of a panel of Vif proteins to induce degradation of rhAPOBEC3 proteins, and mutations within HIV-1 Vif that render it capable of degrading rhAPOBEC3G did not confer activity against other antiviral rhAPOBEC3 proteins. These findings suggest that multiple APOBEC3 proteins can contribute to primate lentivirus species tropism.\",\"The chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family (GPCR), is used by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with a R5 tropism as an entry receptor in addition to CD4. It is a key target for an antiviral action aiming at inhibiting the HIV-1 entry process. Only few data are available today regarding the mechanism involved in the intracellular trafficking process of CCR5. Understanding how CCR5 cell surface expression is regulated is particularly important with regard to HIV-1 entry inhibition. We set out to investigate whether CCR5 molecular determinants were involved in the postendocytic recycling and degradative pathways. We constructed progressive deletion mutants of the C-terminal domain of CCR5 that we stably expressed in HEK293 cells. All of the deletion mutants were expressed at the cell surface and were functional HIV-1 receptors. The deletion mutants were internalized after stimulation, but they lost their ability to recycle to the plasma membrane. They were rerouted toward a lysosomal degradative pathway. We identified here a sequence of four amino acids, present at the extreme C terminus of CCR5, that is necessary for the recycling of the internalized receptor, independently of its phosphorylation. A detailed analysis of this sequence indicated that the four amino acids acted as a postsynaptic density 95/discs-large/zona occludens (PDZ) interacting sequence. These results show that the CCR5 cytoplasmic domain bears a sequence similar to the \\\"recycling signals\\\" previously identified in other GPCRs. Drugs able to disrupt the recycling pathway of CCR5 may constitute promising tools for therapeutic treatment.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tropism plays an important role in HIV-associated dementia. In this study, aimed at determining if the tropism and coreceptor usage of circulating viruses correlates with cognitive function, the authors isolated and characterized HIV from the peripheral blood of 21 Hispanic women using antiretroviral therapy. Macrophage tropism was determined by inoculation of HIV isolates onto monocyte-derived macrophages and lymphocyte cultures. To define coreceptor usage, the HIV isolates were inoculated onto the U87.CD4 glioma cell lines with specific CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors. HIV isolates from cognitively impaired patients showed higher levels of replication in mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells than did isolates from patients with normal cognition (P < .05). The viral growth of HIV primary isolates in macrophages and lymphocytes did not differ between patients with and those without cognitive impairment. However, isolates from the cognitively impaired women preferentially used the X4 coreceptor (P < .05). These phenotypic studies suggest that cognitively impaired HIV-infected women receiving treatment may have a more highly replicating and more pathogenic X4 virus in the circulation that could contribute to their neuropathogenesis.\",\"Reports from southern Africa, an area in which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is caused almost exclusively by subtype C (HIV-1C), have shown increased rates of anemia in HIV-infected populations compared with similar acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients in the United States, an area predominantly infected with subtype B (HIV-1B). Recent findings by our group demonstrated a direct association between HIV-1 infection and hematopoietic progenitor cell health in Botswana. Therefore, using a single-colony infection assay and quantitative proviral analysis, we examined whether HIV-1C could infect hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and whether this phenotype was associated with the higher rates of anemia found in southern Africa. The results show that a significant number of HIV-1C, but not HIV-1B, isolates can infect HPCs in vitro (P < .05). In addition, a portion of HIV-1C-positive Africans had infected progenitor cell populations in vivo, which was associated with higher rates of anemia in these patients (P < .05). This represents a difference in cell tropism between 2 geographically separate and distinct HIV-1 subtypes. The association of this hematotropic phenotype with higher rates of anemia should be considered when examining anti-HIV drug treatment regimens in HIV-1C-predominant areas, such as southern Africa.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor tropism, the ability of the virus to enter cells via CCR5 or CXCR4, is a viral characteristic mediated by the envelope gene. The impact of coreceptor tropism on the natural history of HIV-1 infection has not been fully explored. Coreceptor tropism was measured using a recombinant virus single-cycle assay on plasma specimens obtained at baseline from 126 children and adolescents in the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study cohort who were enrolled from 1989 through 1990 and underwent follow-up through 1997. Detectable CXCR4-using virus at baseline was associated with a lower baseline CD4(+) T cell count and a higher plasma HIV-1 RNA level. In addition, it independently predicted a greater decrease in CD4(+) T cell count over time (P<.001) and was associated with a 3.8-fold increased risk of progression to clinical AIDS. This study demonstrates that coreceptor tropism, as assessed by this single-cycle assay, independently influences the natural history of HIV-1 disease.\",\"CD4-independence has been taken as a sign of a more open envelope structure that is more accessible to neutralizing antibodies and may confer altered cell tropism. In the present study, we analyzed SIVsm isolates for CD4-independent use of CCR5, mode of CCR5-use and macrophage tropism. The isolates have been collected sequentially from 13 experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques and have previously been shown to use CCR5 together with CD4. Furthermore, viruses obtained early after infection were neutralization sensitive, while neutralization resistance appeared already three months after infection in monkeys with progressive immunodeficiency. Depending whether isolated early or late in infection, two phenotypes of CD4-independent use of CCR5 could be observed. The inoculum virus (SIVsm isolate SMM-3) and reisolates obtained early in infection often showed a pronounced CD4-independence since virus production and/or syncytia induction could be detected directly in NP-2 cells expressing CCR5 but not CD4 (CD4-independent-HIGH). Conversely, late isolates were often more CD4-dependent in that productive infection in NP-2/CCR5 cells was in most cases weak and was revealed only after cocultivation of infected NP-2/CCR5 cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CD4-independent-LOW). Considering neutralization sensitivity of these isolates, newly infected macaques often harbored virus populations with a CD4-independent-HIGH and neutralization sensitive phenotype that changed to a CD4-independent-LOW and neutralization resistant virus population in the course of infection. Phenotype changes occurred faster in progressor than long-term non-progressor macaques. The phenotypes were not reflected by macrophage tropism, since all isolates replicated efficiently in macrophages. Infection of cells expressing CCR5/CXCR4 chimeric receptors revealed that SIVsm used the CCR5 receptor in a different mode than HIV-1. Our results show that SIVsm isolates use CCR5 independently of CD4. While the degree of CD4 independence and neutralization sensitivity vary over time, the ability to productively infect monocyte-derived macrophages remains at a steady high level throughout infection. The mode of CCR5 use differs between SIVsm and HIV-1, SIVsm appears to be more flexible than HIV-1 in its receptor requirement. We suggest that the mode of CCR5 coreceptor use and CD4-independence are interrelated properties.\",\"Entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 requires interactions between the envelope glycoprotein (Env) on the virus and CD4 and a chemokine receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, on the cell surface. The V3 loop of the HIV gp120 glycoprotein plays a critical role in this process, determining tropism for CCR5- or CXCR4-expressing cells, but details of how V3 interacts with these receptors have not been defined. Using an iterative process of deletion mutagenesis and in vitro adaptation of infectious viruses, variants of HIV-2 were derived that could replicate without V3, either with or without a deletion of the V1/V2 variable loops. The generation of these functional but markedly minimized Envs required adaptive changes on the gp120 core and gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein. V3-deleted Envs exhibited tropism for both CCR5- and CXCR4-expressing cells, suggesting that domains on the gp120 core were mediating interactions with determinants shared by both coreceptors. Remarkably, HIV-2 Envs with V3 deletions became resistant to small-molecule inhibitors of CCR5 and CXCR4, suggesting that these drugs inhibit wild-type viruses by disrupting a specific V3 interaction with the coreceptor. This study represents a proof of concept that HIV Envs lacking V3 alone or in combination with V1/V2 that retain functional domains required for viral entry can be derived. Such minimized Envs may be useful in understanding Env function, screening for new inhibitors of gp120 core interactions with chemokine receptors, and designing novel immunogens for vaccines.\",\"HIV infects macrophages and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). Mechanisms that enhance HIV macrophage/microglial tropism are not well understood. Here, we identify an HIV Env variant in the V4 region of gp120, Asp 386 (D386), that eliminates an N-linked glycosylation site at position 386, enhances viral replication in macrophages, and is present at a higher frequency in AIDS patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) compared with non-HAD patients. D386 enhances HIV entry and replication in macrophages but not in microglia or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, possibly due to differential glycosylation in these cell types. A D386N mutation in the UK1br Env, which restores the N-linked glycan site, reduced neutralization sensitivity to the IgG1b12 (b12) monoclonal antibody, which recognizes a conserved neutralization epitope that overlaps the CD4 binding site. Molecular modeling suggested that loss of the glycan at position 386 increases exposure of the CD4 and b12 binding sites on gp120. Loss of a glycan at 386 was more frequent in Envs from HAD patients (26%; n=185) compared with non-HAD patients (7%; n=99; p<0.001). The most significant association of these Env variants with HAD was in blood or lymphoid tissue rather than brain. These findings suggest that increased exposure of the b12 epitope overlapping the CD4 binding site via elimination of a glycan at position 386 is associated with enhanced HIV macrophage tropism, and provide evidence that determinants of macrophage and microglia tropism are overlapping but distinct.\",\"The interaction between viral capsid proteins and specific molecules exposed on the plasma membrane of the cells is involved in the viral tropism. A human adenovirus (Ad) belonging to subgroups A, C, D, E and F infects cells via the interaction between the fiber knob and the primary receptor, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Conventional human adenovirus type 5 (hAd5) vectors show efficient transduction in CAR-positive cells; in contrast, hAd5 vector application is limited by poor transduction into cells lacking CAR expression. In the present study, to broaden the tropism of hAd5 vectors, we generated hAd5 vectors containing the TAT peptide, which is a protein transduction domain derived from human immunodeficiency virus, in the HI loop of the fiber knob (Ad-TAT(HI)-L2) or the C-terminus of the fiber knob (Ad-TAT(C)-L2). In CAR-negative adherent cells, Ad-TAT(HI)-L2 and Ad-TAT(C)-L2 showed approximately 50- to 500-fold higher gene expression than the conventional hAd5 vector (Ad-L2). Ad-TAT(HI)-L2 was also more efficient than Ad-L2 in blood cell lines and in two types of primary cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, which are almost refractory to Ad-L2. Furthermore, Ad-TAT(HI)-L2 was more efficient than other types of fiber-modified Ad vectors, which harbor an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) or a poly-lysine (KKKKKKK;K7) peptide in the HI loop or the C-terminus of the fiber knob, respectively. Ad-TAT(HI)-L2 efficiently transduced the organs in levels and patterns that were roughly similar to those of Ad-L2 after being systemically injected into mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report showing that hAd5 vectors containing the TAT peptide in the fiber knob could efficiently transduce cells independently of CAR. These Ad vectors should be useful for gene functional analysis and gene therapy.\",\"Very little is known about the influence of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) on the surface expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 with respect to receptor tropism and replication kinetics of autologous HIV strains, during continuous therapy and structured treatment interruption (STI) regimens. The main objectives of this study were to assess whether continuous therapy and STI regimens had any modulatory effects on expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 on T lymphocytes. We studied 6 patients on continuous HAART, 4 patients on STI and 1 treatment-na\\u00efve patient. Sequential peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples were analyzed to determine viral replication kinetics, the genotype influencing tropism of the autologous strain, in vitro co-receptor usage patterns in relation to the surface expression of each co-receptor. Our data suggest that predominant CCR5 expression and tropism, during therapy, but significant down-modulation of CXCR4 expression. During the off-therapy phases of STI, CXCR4 expression increased, which correlated with increased CXCR4 tropism of isolates from these time points. In-vitro tropism during therapy was consistent with the HIV-1 V3 genotype, which was characteristic of CCR5 using strains. These results suggest that certain HAART regimens influence the surface expression of CXCR4, which may have profound implications for antiretroviral treatment.\",\"HIV-1 co-receptor usage may play a critical role in AIDS pathogenesis. Information on viral tropism in HIV-1 seroconverters is scarce, as is the relationship with transmission of drug-resistant viruses. All consecutive HIV-1 seroconverters seen between January 1997 and December 2005 in 17 Spanish hospitals were retrospectively analysed. V3 loop amino acid sequences derived from plasma RNA at the time of initial diagnosis were used to predict co-receptor usage. Major drug resistance mutations, plasma HIV RNA, CD4 counts and HIV subtype were considered for subsequent analyses. A total of 296 HIV-1 seroconverters were identified (84% male; median age 30 years; 61% homosexual men). Median estimated time from infection was 7 months (interquartile range, 3-11). Primary drug resistance mutations were seen in 12.5%, being 9.5% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), 4.4% for non-NRTI (NNRTI) and 3% for protease inhibitors (PI). Twenty-four (8.1%) carried non-B subtypes. HIV tropism could be characterized in 203 seroconverters (69%). X4 viruses (either pure or dual/mixed R5/X4) were recognized in 35 (17.2%). There was no association between HIV tropism and mean plasma HIV RNA (4.5 versus 4.4 log copies/mL in R5 versus X4, respectively; P = 0.45) or mean CD4 counts (594 versus 554 cells/mm(3), respectively; P = 0.48). The proportion of X4 viruses did not differ in patients infected with wild-type or drug-resistant viruses (17% versus 18%, P = 1). Intravenous drug users tended to show X4 viruses more frequently than individuals infected by sexual relationships (35.7% versus 16.5%, respectively; P = 0.073). After 12 months of follow-up in 78 seroconverters who did not start antiretroviral therapy, more pronounced increases in plasma HIV RNA (+5056 versus -3430) and declines in CD4 cell counts (-126 versus -60) were seen in X4 compared with R5 carriers. A significant proportion of recent HIV-1 seroconverters harbour X4 viruses (17.2%), without any evidence of association between co-receptor usage, transmission of drug-resistant viruses and HIV subtype.\",\"Recombinant adenoviral (rAd) vectors elicit potent cellular and humoral immune responses and show promise as vaccines for HIV-1, Ebola virus, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infections. These vectors are now widely used and have been generally well tolerated in vaccine and gene therapy clinical trials, with many thousands of people exposed. At the same time, dose-limiting adverse responses have been observed, including transient low-grade fevers and a prior human gene therapy fatality, after systemic high-dose recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector administration in a human gene therapy trial. The mechanism responsible for these effects is poorly understood. Here, we define the mechanism by which Ad5 targets immune cells that stimulate adaptive immunity. rAd5 tropism for dendritic cells (DCs) was independent of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), its primary receptor or the secondary integrin RGD receptor, and was mediated instead by a heparin-sensitive receptor recognized by a distinct segment of the Ad5 fiber, the shaft. rAd vectors with CAR and RGD mutations did not infect a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types but retained their ability to transfect several DC types and stimulated adaptive immune responses in mice. Notably, the pyrogenic response to the administration of rAd5 also localized to the shaft region, suggesting that this interaction elicits both protective immunity and vector-induced fevers. The ability of replication-defective rAd5 viruses to elicit potent immune responses is mediated by a heparin-sensitive receptor that interacts with the Ad5 fiber shaft. Mutant CAR and RGD rAd vectors target several DC and mononuclear subsets and induce both adaptive immunity and toxicity. Understanding of these interactions facilitates the development of vectors that target DCs through alternative receptors that can improve safety while retaining the immunogenicity of rAd vaccines.\",\"Emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) populations that switch or broaden coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 is intimately coupled to CD4+ cell depletion and disease progression toward AIDS. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the coreceptor switch, we determined the nucleotide sequences of 253 V1 to V3 env clones from 27 sequential HIV-1 subtype B isolates from four patients with virus populations that switch coreceptor usage. Coreceptor usage of clones from dualtropic R5X4 isolates was characterized experimentally. Sequence analysis revealed that 9% of the clones from CXCR4-using isolates had originated by recombination events between R5 and X4 viruses. The majority (73%) of the recombinants used CXCR4. Furthermore, coreceptor usage of the recombinants was determined by a small region of the envelope, including V3. This is the first report demonstrating that intrapatient recombination between viruses with distinct coreceptor usage occurs frequently. It has been proposed that X4 viruses are more easily suppressed by the immune system than R5 viruses. We hypothesize that recombination between circulating R5 viruses and X4 viruses can result in chimeric viruses with the potential to both evade the immune system and infect CXCR4-expressing cells. The broadening in cell tropism of the viral population to include CXCR4-expressing cells would gradually impair the immune system and eventually allow the X4 population to expand. In conclusion, intrapatient recombination between viruses with distinct coreceptor usage may contribute to the emergence of X4 viruses in later stages of infection.\",\"Viral latency is a reversibly non-productive state of infection that allows some viruses to evade host immune responses. As a consequence of its tropism for activated CD4(+) T cells, HIV-1 can establish latent infection in resting memory CD4(+) T cells, which are generated when activated CD4(+) T cells return to a quiescent state. Latent HIV-1 persists as a stably integrated but transcriptionally silent provirus. In this state, the virus is unaffected by immune responses or antiretroviral drugs, and this latent reservoir in resting CD4(+) T cells is a major barrier to curing the infection. Unfortunately, there is no simple assay to measure the number of latently infected cells in a patient, nor is there an entirely representative in vitro model in which to explore the molecular mechanisms of latency. This Review will consider current approaches to the analysis of HIV-1 latency both in vivo and in vitro.\",\"Here we address whether CCR5 or CXCR4 tropism of the predominant viral strain detected before or on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) explains why some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who begin ART with advanced HIV disease retain low interferon (IFN)-gamma responses, despite recovery of CD4(+) T cell counts. Tropism was determined by culture and confirmed by gp120 V3 loop sequence of multiple plasma samples in eight adult male patients who began treatment with <50 CD4(+) T cells/microL. Four patients had mixed infections, one had only R5 HIV, and three had only X4 HIV. Of these, two carried CCR5Delta32. Viral tropism was not related to CD4(+) T cell counts or HIV RNA levels. When immunological responses were monitored over several years, IFN-gamma responses to cytomegalovirus were below the median value of uninfected controls and similar in patients with R5, X4, or mixed infection. Interleukin-5 responses were low and plasma soluble CD30 levels were high at treatment onset, but resolved with control of HIV replication irrespective of HIV tropism. Levels of LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein) were elevated in patients with uncontrolled HIV replication. Hence the immunological milieu did not reflect HIV tropism.\",\"Long-term survival of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been noted in rare cohorts of individuals infected with nef-deleted virus. Enhanced macrophage tropism and cytopathicity contribute to pathogenicity of wild type HIV-1. To better understand the pathogenesis of nef-deleted HIV-1, we analyzed the replication capacity and macrophage cytopathicity of nef-deleted HIV-1 isolated sequentially from a long-term survivor during progression to AIDS (n=6 isolates). Compared with controls, all nef-deleted viruses replicated to low levels in peripheral blood mononu-clear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). One nef-deleted virus that was isolated on the development of AIDS caused high levels of syncytia in MDM similar to control viruses, but five viruses isolated from earlier times prior to AIDS onset caused only minimal cytopathicity. Together, these results suggest that enhanced cytopathicity of nef-deleted HIV-1 for MDM can occur independently of replication capacity, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of nef-deleted HIV-1 infection.\",\"We studied a case of recent infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) HIV-1. Over 16 months off-therapy, the CD4 cell count decreased from 419 to 184 cells/mul. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) then led to an incomplete virological response but to an immunological benefit, concurrently with a shift to CCR5-only tropism and a reduction in replication capacity. ART, even if suboptimal, can be of interest in the case of MDR virus infection.\",\"Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains require either the CXCR4 or CCR5 chemokine receptor to efficiently enter cells. Blocking viral binding to these coreceptors is an attractive therapeutic target. Currently, several coreceptor antagonists are being evaluated in clinical trials that require characterization of coreceptor tropism for enrollment. In this report, we describe the development of an automated and accurate procedure for determining HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (Trofile) and its validation for routine laboratory testing. HIV-1 pseudoviruses are generated using full-length env genes derived from patient virus populations. Coreceptor tropism is determined by measuring the abilities of these pseudovirus populations to efficiently infect CD4+/U87 cells expressing either the CXCR4 or CCR5 coreceptor. Viruses exclusively and efficiently infecting CXCR4+/CD4+/U87 cells are designated X4-tropic. Conversely, viruses exclusively and efficiently infecting CCR5+/CD4+/U87 cells are designated R5-tropic. Viruses capable of infecting both CXCR4+/CD4+/U87 and CCR5+/CD4+/U87 cells are designated dual/mixed-tropic. Assay accuracy and reproducibility were established by evaluating the tropisms of well-characterized viruses and the variability among replicate results from samples tested repeatedly. The viral subtype, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus coinfection, and the plasma viral load did not affect assay performance. Minority subpopulations with alternate tropisms were reliably detected when present at 5 to 10%. The plasma viral load above which samples can be amplified efficiently in the Trofile assay is 1,000 copies per ml of plasma. Trofile has been automated for high-throughput use; it can be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment regimens that include a coreceptor inhibitor and to monitor patients on treatment for the emergence of resistant virus populations that switch coreceptor tropism.\",\"HIV infects macrophages and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS), which express lower levels of CD4 than CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood. To investigate mechanisms of HIV neurotropism, full-length env genes were cloned from autopsy brain and lymphoid tissues from 4 AIDS patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Characterization of 55 functional Env clones demonstrated that Envs with reduced dependence on CD4 for fusion and viral entry are more frequent in brain compared to lymphoid tissue. Envs that mediated efficient entry into macrophages were frequent in brain but were also present in lymphoid tissue. For most Envs, entry into macrophages correlated with overall fusion activity at all levels of CD4 and CCR5. gp160 nucleotide sequences were compartmentalized in brain versus lymphoid tissue within each patient. Proline at position 308 in the V3 loop of gp120 was associated with brain compartmentalization in 3 patients, but mutagenesis studies suggested that P308 alone does not contribute to reduced CD4 dependence or macrophage-tropism. These results suggest that HIV adaptation to replicate in the CNS selects for Envs with reduced CD4 dependence and increased fusion activity. Macrophage-tropic Envs are frequent in brain but are also present in lymphoid tissues of AIDS patients with HAD, and entry into macrophages in the CNS and other tissues is dependent on the ability to use low receptor levels and overall efficiency of fusion.\",\"Pertussis toxin (PTX) and its binding unit (PTX-B) have been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection of primary cells. However, the anti-HIV mechanisms have yet to be defined. We demonstrate that PTX inhibits HIV-1 infection of human cervical tissue independently of viral tropism. PTX-B showed a similar pattern of HIV-1 inhibition. Further investigation in macrophages demonstrated that PTX/PTX-B inhibited HIV-1 expression but that other G protein inhibitors and activators had no effect on HIV-1 replication. Unlike the anti-HIV bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the anti-HIV effects of PTX/PTX-B were not due to beta -chemokine production or coreceptor down-modulation, but they were dependent on interaction with cell-surface receptors. Antibody blocking studies suggested that cell-surface CD14 is very likely to be the principal receptor involved in the anti-HIV effects of PTX/PTX-B. This was further strengthened by the results of surface plasmon resonance analyses. Further definition of the mechanisms of such inhibition may lead to the development of novel HIV-1 prevention strategies.\",\"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a widespread, persistent herpesvirus that can transform B cells and that is associated with malignant lymphomas. EBV dynamics and specific immunity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected children are unknown. We found that, in 74% of EBV-seropositive, HIV-1-infected children, EBV DNA loads at the start of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were comparable with those in acutely EBV-infected, HIV-negative children. EBV DNA load remained elevated in most HIV-1-infected children for months to years of follow-up. Frequencies of interferon-gamma-producing EBV-specific CD8+ T cells were comparable with those in healthy control children, and antibodies to EBV nuclear antigen were detected in 73% of EBV-seropositive children. Detectable EBV DNA load was not correlated with HIV-1 RNA level or with CD4+ T cell count increase after the start of HAART. Because of its resemblance to chronic active EBV, we studied the cellular tropism of EBV in these patients. EBV DNA was found not only in the CD19+ B cell fraction but also--at stable levels--in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell fractions. Although the reason for the aberrant T cell tropism of EBV remains unclear, these data may provide an explanation for the differential EBV dynamics in the presence of normal serological findings.\",\"The design of effective prophylactic measures to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV-1 and of therapies to alter the natural progression of pediatric HIV disease requires a thorough understanding of basic pathogenetic principles. Maternal viral load, the biological behavior of HIV, such as replicative capacity in different types of cells, monocyte/macrophage tropism, and the capacity of the infant's cells to support infection have all been assessed for their contribution to the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Similarly, the effects of viral load and phenotype (e.g. replicative capacity, cell tropism, syncytium-inducing capacity and the use of chemokine co-receptors) have all been investigated as parameters associated with variations in the expression of clinical disease in children. Some of the extant data are conflicting, but general principles regarding pathogenesis are beginning to emerge.\",\"CCR5 expression determines susceptibility to infection, cell tropism, and the rate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease progression. CCR5 is also considered the major HIV-2 coreceptor in vivo, in spite of broad coreceptor use in vitro. Here we report a significantly increased proportion of memory-effector CD4 T cells expressing CCR5 in HIV-2-infected patients correlating with CD4 depletion. Moreover, HIV-2 proviral DNA was essentially restricted to memory-effector CD4, suggesting that this is the main target for HIV-2. Similar levels of proviral DNA were found in the two infection categories. Thus, the reduced viremia and slow rate of CD4 decline that characterize HIV-2 infection seem to be unrelated to coreceptor availability.\",\"Rapidly evolving viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) develop marked sequence differences in their genome over the course of an epidemic and in individuals infected for longer duration. This is because of the error prone reverse transcriptase (RT), which rapidly incorporates mutations resulting in genomic diversity, altered cell tropism, immune escape, and variable resistance to antiretroviral drugs. As a result, radically different genomic combinations may be generated in individuals infected by genetically diverse viruses that have mosaic genomes. Whole blood sample was collected from 25 HIV-1 infected patients. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Full-length gag gene (~1.5 kb) was amplified. PCR products were subjected to direct automated sequencing. For identification of recombinants Simplot version 2.5 was used. Out of 25 gag genes that were sequenced, the gene amplified from a 29 years old HIV-1 seropositive male revealed a putative recombinant sequence. This sequence showed maximum homology with HIV-1 subtype A. Simplot analysis revealed the sequence to be a likely recombinant with the following composition: Initial stretch of 1 to 200 nucleotides representing AE circulating recombinant form (CRF), 201 to 440 nucleotides representing HIV-1 subtype A, 441 to 660 nucleotides representing AE CRF again, 661 to 700 nucleotides representing HIV-1 subtype A and the remaining stretch of the nucleotides from 701 to 1076 representing AE CRF. We document a putative HIV-1 subtype A/ AE CRF. It is important to monitor various CRFs that are being generated and horizontally spread in the community. This has significant implications for development of candidate vaccine for India.\",\"The ability of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 to 8 (AAV1 to AAV8) vectors expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Env gp160 (AAV-HIV) to induce an immune response was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The AAV5 vector showed a higher tropism for both mouse and human dendritic cells (DCs) than did the AAV2 vector, whereas other AAV serotype vectors transduced DCs only poorly. AAV1, AAV5, AAV7, and AAV8 were more highly expressed in muscle cells than AAV2. An immunogenicity study of AAV serotypes indicates that AAV1, AAV5, AAV7, and AAV8 vectors expressing the Env gp160 gene induced higher HIV-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses than the AAV2 vector did, with the AAV5 vector producing the best responses. Furthermore, mice injected with DCs that had been transduced ex vivo with an AAV5 vector expressing the gp160 gene elicited higher HIV-specific cell-mediated immune responses than did DCs transduced with AAV1 and AAV2 vectors. We also found that AAV vectors produced by HEK293 cells and insect cells elicit similar levels of antigen-specific immune responses. These results demonstrate that the immunogenicity of AAV vectors depends on their tropism for both antigen-presenting cells (such as DCs) and non-antigen-presenting cells (such as muscular cells) and that AAV5 is a better vector than other AAV serotypes. These results may aid in the development of AAV-based vaccine and gene therapy.\",\"Late stage AIDS associated CCR5 tropic HIV-1 clones (R5-AIDS HIV-1) exhibit greater cytopathic effects (CPE) than earlier isolates from the same patients. In this study, envelopes from a series of three biological clones derived from the same patient were evaluated as a cytopathic determinant of R5-AIDS HIV-1 for thymocytes. In a single round of replication in thymocytes, the AIDS associated clone mediated greater initiation of reverse transcription. This enhancement was not due to broadened coreceptor tropism, as all clones studied were exclusively R5 tropic. The full-length R5-AIDS env mediated greater infectivity than R5 pre-AIDS env when used to pseudotype a reporter virus. R5-AIDS env pseudotypes were more resistant to TAK-779 and showed more rapid infection kinetics but similar resistance to a CD4 blocking mAb. We conclude that the enhanced thymic replication and CPE shown by the R5-AIDS clone is due to enhanced efficiency of Env-mediated entry via CCR5.\",\"Previously, we demonstrated that the expression of a nonneutralizing human anti-HIV-1 gp41 scFv on the surface of HIV-1-susceptible cells markedly inhibits HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion. The inhibition is at the level of viral entry, specific for the HIV-1 envelope, and independent of virus tropism. In the previous studies, cell-free viruses of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains from subtype B were used to infect human CD4 T cell lines. To further test the effectiveness of this membrane-bound scFv (m-scFv) on HIV-1 infection, in this study, we carried out experiments to determine whether the m-scFv can neutralize infection of primary isolates from various HIV-1 subtypes and whether the m-scFv can neutralize HIV-1 captured and transferred by DC-SIGN on the surface of monocytic cell lines or DCs. We demonstrated that the m-scFv markedly inhibits primary isolates derived from various subtypes and significantly blocks HIV-1 captured and transferred by DC-SIGN on monocytic cell lines and on human DCs. Therefore, a nonneutralizing antibody acts as a broad neutralizing antibody when expressed on the cell surface, which significantly inhibits infection of both cell-free and DC-SIGN-captured and transferred virus. Our studies further point out the potential use of m-scFv as a inhibitor against HIV-1 transmission as well as a tool to dissect the mechanism of HIV-1 entry via DC-SIGN capture and transfer to CD4 T cells.\",\"Chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 play a key role in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) entry into CD4+ monocytic cells. Alteration in the expression levels of these receptors by immunoregulatory cytokines may influence viral entry and hence susceptibility to HIV infection, viral tropism, and disease progression. Helper T cell type 2 (Th2) cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, which share a subunit of their receptor components and exhibit similar biological effects, have been shown to play a key role in HIV infection and disease progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of IL-4 and IL-13 on the expression of CXCR4 and CCR5, and the biological implications of alteration of CXCR4 and CCR5 regulation on monocytic cells with respect to their migration in response to chemokines, HIV entry, and its replication. The results suggest that both IL-4 and IL-13 inhibited the expression of CXCR4, in contrast to CCR5, which was inhibited by IL-13 alone. The downregulation of CXCR4 and CCR5 was correspondingly associated with the inhibition of their respective ligand-induced chemotaxis. Although IL-13 inhibited the expression of both CXCR4 and CCR5, this downregulation of chemokine receptor expression was not sufficient to prevent virus entry. Furthermore, both IL-4 and IL-13 inhibited viral replication in monocytic cells, suggesting that inhibition of chemokine receptor expression per se by these cytokines may not be sufficient to prevent virus entry, and indicating these cytokines may be inhibiting viral replication by targeting pathways subsequent to virus entry.\",\"Based on the published NMR spectroscopy data, three-dimensional structures of the HIV-1 gp120 protein V3 loop were obtained by computer modeling in the viral strains HIV-Haiti and HIV-MN. In both cases, the secondary structure elements and conformations of irregular stretches were determined for the fragment representing the principal antigenic determinant of the virus, as well as determinants of the cellular tropism and syncytium formation. Notwithstanding the high variability of the amino acid sequence of gp120 protein, more than 50% of the V3 loop residues retained their conformations in the different HIV-1 virions. The combined analysis of the findings and the literature data on the biological activity of the individual residues of the HIV-1 V3 loop resulted in identification of its structurally conservative amino acids, which seem to be promising targets for antiviral drug design by protein engineering approaches.\",\"Recombinant retroviruses, including lentiviruses, are the most widely used vectors for both in vitro and in vivo stable gene transfer. However, the inability to selectively deliver transgenes into cells of interest limits the use of this technology. Due to its wide tropism, stability and ability to pseudotype a range of viral vectors, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) is the most commonly used pseudotyping protein. Here, we attempted to engineer this protein for targeting purposes. Chimaeric VSV-G proteins were constructed by linking a cell-directing single-chain antibody (scFv) to its N-terminal. We show that the chimaeric VSV-G molecules can integrate into retroviral and lentiviral particles. HIV-1 particles pseudotyped with VSV-G linked to an scFv against human Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) bind strongly and specifically to human cells. Also, this novel molecule preferentially drives lentiviral transduction of human cells, although the titre is considerably lower that viruses pseudotyped with VSV-G. This is likely due to the inefficient fusion activity of the modified protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report where VSV-G was successfully engineered to include a large (253 amino acids) exogenous peptide and where attempts were made to change the infection profile of VSV-G pseudotyped vectors.\",\"HIV-1 infection of cells is mediated by engagement between viral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and a receptor complex comprising CD4 and one of two chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, expressed on the surface of target cells. Most CD4+-transformed T cell lines express only CXCR4, but primary lymphocytes and macrophages, the main cellular targets for infection in vivo, express both coreceptors. Cell- and viral strain-specific utilization of these coreceptor pathways, rather than coreceptor expression per se, regulates lymphocyte and macrophage entry and tropism. Virus use of coreceptor[s] (R5, X4, or R5 and X4) and its target cell tropism (lymphocytes, macrophages, and/or transformed T cell lines) are related but distinct characteristics of Envs. A comprehensive classification schema of HIV-1 Env phenotypes that addresses both tropism and coreceptor use is proposed. Defining Env phenotype based on both parameters is important in the development of entry inhibitors and vaccines, for understanding changes in Env that evolve over time in vivo, and for discerning differences among viral species that underlie aspects of pathogenesis and transmission. Recognizing how tropism is related to, yet differs from, coreceptor selectivity is critical for understanding the mechanisms by which these viral characteristics impact pathogenesis.\",\"The cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein (gp41) contains sequences that affect the trafficking of Env within the host cell. We previously showed that the membrane-proximal tyrosine-based adaptor protein (AP)-binding signal of gp41 (Y712XXL) is required for optimal viral infectivity and entry into target cells. Because these effects were not attributable to an effect on the incorporation of Env into virions, we hypothesized that they involved targeting of viral assembly to specific endosomal membranes that conferred greater fusogenicity. To further elaborate this hypothesis, we mutated the C-terminal leucine-based AP-binding signal of gp41 (LL855/856). In contrast to Env Y712, the leucine signal was dispensable for viral infectivity in both single cycle assays and during spreading infections within cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To test the hypothesis that these AP-binding motifs target Env to endosomes during viral morphogenesis, we compared the subcellular localization of wild-type Env to mutants of the Y712 and LL855/856 signals. The results failed to support the hypothesis that these signals target viral assembly to specific endosomal membranes. Strikingly, in the context of a C2-V3 region that confers macrophage-tropism, mutation of Y712 no longer markedly affected viral infectivity in either single cycle assays or during spreading infection within PBMCs, and it did not impair viral entry. These data indicate that the importance of the tyrosine-based sorting signal in gp41 for optimal viral infectivity depends on sequences in gp120. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the Y712 residue is part of the ectodomain of gp41 in virion-associated Env. We speculate that as part of the ectodomain, Y712 could affect specifically the conformation of the more positively charged CXCR4-tropic V3 loop in a manner that augments viral fusogenicity and infectivity.\",\"Studies were conducted to elucidate co-receptor spectrum and function of the inflammatory receptor, CMKLR1/ChemR23, which was recently identified as the receptor for the cystatin-like chemoattractant, TIG2, also named chemerin. An infection model was applied based on stably transfected NP-2.CD4 host cells expressing various co-receptor constructs and exposed to panels of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV primary isolates. In a panel of 27 HIV-1 isolates tested, 12 isolates could use CMKLR1/ChemR23. As expected from a relatively high sequence homology with the extracellular domains of CCR3, HIV-1 isolates showing R3 tropism were particularly efficient in using CMKLR1/ChemR23. In addition, 5 out of 7 HIV-2 isolates and 13 out of 15 SIV (SMM-3 origin) used CMKLR1/ChemR23, in accordance with the previously documented ability of these isolates to use several co-receptors. In order to define important extracellular epitopes for the viral interaction, a hybrid receptor model was applied. This was based on the fact that the rat receptor, although structurally very similar to the human orthologue, was inefficient as viral co-receptor. When the rat receptor was \\\"humanized\\\" to include regions unique to the human receptor (N-terminus or second extracellular loop), exposure to HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV isolates resulted in infection. The relative importance of the two critical receptor regions differed between HIV-1/HIV-2 on the one hand and SIV on the other. The results strongly support that the chemerin receptor, in the presence of CD4, functions as a \\\"minor co-receptor\\\" promoting infection by these classes of viruses.\",\"Membrane cholesterol plays an important role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particle production and infectivity. Here, we have investigated the target and mechanism of action of a cholesterol-binding compound, the polyene antifungal antibiotic amphotericin B methyl ester (AME). We found that AME potently inhibited the replication of a highly divergent panel of HIV-1 isolates in various T-cell lines and primary cells irrespective of clade or target cell tropism. The defects in HIV-1 replication caused by AME were due to profoundly impaired viral infectivity as well as a defect in viral particle production. To elucidate further the mechanism of action of AME, we selected for and characterized AME-resistant HIV-1 variants. Mutations responsible for AME resistance mapped to a highly conserved and functionally important endocytosis motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. Interestingly, truncation of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail in the context of either HIV-1 or rhesus macaque simian immunodeficiency virus also conferred resistance to AME. The infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins was unaffected by AME. Our data define the target and mechanism of action of AME and provide support for the concept that cholesterol-binding compounds should be pursued as antiretroviral drugs to disrupt HIV-1 replication.\",\"Since their discovery in 1996, the two main coreceptors used by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to enter human cells (CCR5 and CXCR4) have been the subject of numerous scientific articles. A recent search in PubMed (www.pubmed.gov) using \\\"HIV coreceptor\\\" as keywords led to more than 1100 original research publications and 90 review articles. This number skyrocketed to more than double if we used \\\"HIV CCR5\\\". Most of the reviews described in detail several aspects of HIV tropism, viral entry mechanism, coreceptor usage and its implication on disease progression, antiretroviral therapy, and vaccine development. A few others centered on the tools utilized to measure the ability of HIV to use these coreceptors to infect target cells. On the other hand, identification of the HIV coreceptors renewed the effort and expectation to block HIV replication by targeting viral entry into the target cells. As with HIV tropism, hundreds of articles have been published addressing this topic (more than 350 original publications and 50 review articles when using \\\"HIV entry inhibitor\\\" as a descriptive word). Therefore, in addition to providing a brief update of the most important aspects described above, we discuss here how an accurate quantification of HIV coreceptor usage is essential for the successful management of HIV-infected individuals in this new era of entry inhibitors, mainly CCR5- or CXCR4-antagonists.\",\"There has been increasing interest in the identification of novel HIV entry inhibitors. For the discovery of these entry inhibitors, robust surrogate anti-HIV assays are highly desired. The authors report a novel anti-HIV assay system using Moloney murine leukemia viruses (MMLVs) pseudotyped with cytoplasmic tail-truncated HIV envelope protein gp140. These pseudotyped MMLV-HIVgp140 viral particles carry luciferase transcripts; therefore, robust luciferase signal can be detected in cells infected by these pseudotypes. Polycationic agent polybrene and spinoculation markedly enhanced the infection efficiency of these pseudotypes. It was demonstrated that the tropism of these pseudotypes is dependent on the pseudotyped HIV envelope proteins. MMLV viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an R5 HIV virus specifically infect CCR5-expressing cells, and viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an X4 HIV virus specifically infect CXCR4-expressing cells. Furthermore, CCR5 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(R5) infections, and CXCR4 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(X4) infections. A variety of known HIV entry inhibitors were tested in both R5- and X4-dependent pseudotype antiviral assays, and the IC50 values generated were consistent with published results. The pseudotype antiviral assay was also used in the characterization of hundreds of novel CCR5 antagonists. The IC50 values determined in this assay were compared with those determined in HIV antiviral and cell-cell fusion (CCF) assays, and good correlation was found between pseudotype antiviral assay and HIV antiviral assay (R2 = 0.9) or CCF assay (R2 = 0.8).\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infects macrophages and microglia in the CNS and frequently causes neurocognitive impairment. Although antiviral therapy generally reduces the viral load in the CNS and improves HIV-associated neurological dysfunction, most current antiviral drugs have poor CNS penetrance and cannot completely suppress viral replication. Furthermore, drug-resistance mutations can evolve independently in the CNS. Thus, a long-lived viral reservoir persists in macrophages and microglia in the brain despite antiviral therapy. This review discusses mechanisms underlying the neurotropism of HIV, focusing on the role of the HIV envelope glycoproteins and their interactions with CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. We review data from studies of neurotropic HIV derived from the brains of patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment as well as studies of nonhuman primate models. Understanding mechanisms that underlie HIV neurotropism and neurovirulence is critical for development of therapeutics to inhibit CNS infection and preventing neurological injury in HIV-infected individuals.\",\"CRF02_AG is the predominant HIV strain circulating in West and West Central Africa. The aim of this study was to test whether this predominance is associated with a higher in vitro replicative fitness relative to parental subtype A and G viruses. Primary HIV-1 isolates (10 CRF02_AG, 5 subtype A and 5 subtype G) were obtained from a well-described Cameroonian cohort. Growth competition experiments were carried out at equal multiplicity of infection in activated T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MO-DC) in parallel. Dual infection/competition experiments in activated T cells clearly indicated that CRF02_AG isolates had a significant replication advantage over the subtype A and subtype G viruses. The higher fitness of CRF02_AG was evident for isolates from patients with CD4+ T cell counts >200 cells/microL (non-AIDS) or CD4+ T cell counts <200 cells/microL (AIDS), and was independent of the co-receptor tropism. In MO-DC cultures, CRF02_AG isolates showed a slightly but not significantly higher replication advantage compared to subtype A or G isolates. We observed a higher ex vivo replicative fitness of CRF02_AG isolates compared to subtype A and G viruses from the same geographic region and showed that this was independent of the co-receptor tropism and irrespective of high or low CD4+ T cell count. This advantage in replicative fitness may contribute to the dominant spread of CRF02_AG over A and G subtypes in West and West Central Africa.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) R5 isolates that predominantly use CCR5 as a coreceptor are frequently described as macrophage tropic. Here, we compare macrophage tropism conferred by HIV-1 R5 envelopes that were derived directly by PCR from patient tissue. This approach avoids potentially selective culture protocols used in virus isolation. Envelopes were amplified (i) from blood and semen of adult patients and (ii) from plasma of pediatric patients. The phenotypes of these envelopes were compared to those conferred by an extended panel of envelopes derived from brain and lymph node that we reported previously. Our results show that R5 envelopes vary by up to 1,000-fold in their capacity to confer infection of primary macrophages. Highly macrophage-tropic envelopes were predominate in brain but were infrequent in semen, blood, and lymph node samples. We also confirmed that the presence of N283 in the C2 CD4 binding site of gp120 is associated with HIV-1 envelopes from the brain but absent from macrophage-tropic envelopes amplified from blood and semen. Finally, we compared infection of macrophages, CD4(+) T cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) conferred by macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic envelopes in the context of full-length replication competent viral clones. Non-macrophage-tropic envelopes conferred low-level infection of macrophages yet infected CD4(+) T cells and PBMCs as efficiently as highly macrophage-tropic brain envelopes. The lack of macrophage tropism for the majority of the envelopes amplified from lymph node, blood, and semen is striking and contrasts with the current consensus that R5 primary isolates are generally macrophage tropic. The extensive variation in R5 tropism reported here is likely to have an important impact on pathogenesis and on the capacity of HIV-1 to transmit.\",\"For studies of motor neuron function or for therapeutic purposes, novel pseudotype HIV-1-based vectors were developed that are capable of expressing transgenes in motor neurons following injection into mouse hind limb muscles. To specifically target motor neurons, glycoproteins from two rabies virus (RV) isolates, the mouse-brain adapted challenge virus 24 (CVS-24) variants, CVS-N2c and CVS-B2c were evaluated for pseudotype formation with an HIV-1-based vector. Both RV glycoproteins incorporated into vector envelopes, and both pseudotypes yielded high titers with Hek293T and cortical plate neuron cultures. Increased neuronotropism by the CVS-N2c pseudotype was not observed, suggesting that vector tropism is not solely determined by the fusogenic viral glycoprotein. Vector injection into hind limb muscles resulted in EYFP reporter gene expression in the injected muscle fibers and in spinal cord motor neurons innervating the same muscle, indicating retrograde vector transport. Intramuscular vector injections into the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles transduced 26% and 16% of all motor neurons in each motor nucleus, respectively. These transduction efficiencies may allow novel approaches to functional studies of the motor system and the treatment of neuromuscular disease.\",\"Lentiviral vectors are increasingly used for preclinical models of gene therapy and other forms of experimental transgenesis. Due to the broad tropism and the ability for concentration by ultracentrifugation, most lentiviral vector preparations are produced using the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-g) protein as envelope. Recently, Hanawa and colleagues have demonstrated that the ecotropic envelope protein of murine leukemia viruses allows efficient pseudotyping of HIV-1-derived vector particles. However, this method has found little acceptance, despite potential advantages. We produced lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with murine ecotropic envelope using a four-plasmid transient transfection system and evaluated their performance in murine fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. Titers of lentiviral \\\"ecotropic\\\" supernatants were only slightly lower than those produced with VSV-g, could be concentrated by overnight centrifugation (13,000g), and efficiently transduced murine fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells but not human cells. Our Institutional Biosafety Committee agreed on the production and use of replication-defective lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with murine ecotropic envelope under biosafety level 1 (BL1) conditions with additional BL2 practices. We also obtained useful guidelines for the work with human infectious lentiviral vectors. For the researcher, \\\"ecotropic\\\" lentiviral vectors significantly improve the convenience of daily work, compared to the conditions required for lentiviral pseudotypes that are capable of infecting human cells. High efficiency and superior biosafety in combination with convenient handling will certainly boost the potential applicability of this important vector system.\",\"Antagonists of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor, CCR5, are being developed as the first anti-HIV agents acting on a host cell target. We monitored the coreceptor tropism of circulating virus, screened at baseline for coreceptor tropism, in 64 HIV-1-infected patients who received maraviroc (MVC, UK-427,857) as monotherapy for 10 days. Sixty-two patients harbored CCR5-tropic virus at baseline and had a posttreatment phenotype result. Circulating virus remained CCR5 tropic in 60/62 patients, 51 of whom experienced an HIV RNA reduction from baseline of >1 log(10) copies/ml, indicating that CXCR4-using variants were not rapidly selected despite CCR5-specific drug pressure. In two patients, viral load declined during treatment and CXCR4-using virus was detected at day 11. No pretreatment factor predicted the emergence of CXCR4-tropic virus during maraviroc therapy in these two patients. Phylogenetic analysis of envelope (Env) clones from pre- and posttreatment time points indicated that the CXCR4-using variants probably emerged by outgrowth of a pretreatment CXCR4-using reservoir, rather than via coreceptor switch of a CCR5-tropic clone under selection pressure from maraviroc. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed on Env clones from a third patient harboring CXCR4-using virus prior to treatment. This patient was enrolled due to a sample labeling error. Although this patient experienced no overall reduction in viral load in response to treatment, the CCR5-tropic components of the circulating virus did appear to be suppressed while receiving maraviroc as monotherapy. Importantly, in all three patients, circulating virus reverted to predominantly CCR5 tropic following cessation of maraviroc.\",\"We describe in this paper that the dolabellane diterpene 8,10,18-trihydroxy-2,6-dolabelladiene (3), isolated from the marine algae Dictyota pfaffii, inhibits the HIV-1 infection in human primary cells and tumor cell lines. We initially observed that compound 3 inhibited the activity of a purified HIV-1 enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC (50) value of 16.5 +/- 4.3 microM. Next, we found that compound 3 inhibited HIV-1 infection by an R5-tropic isolate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a dose-dependent manner with an EC (50) value of 8.4 +/- 2.8 microM. The replication of HIV-1 isolates presenting distinct tropism for chemokine receptors was also inhibited, as analyzed in PBMCs or U87 cells infected with R5-, X4- or R5X4-tropic isolates. Likewise, compound 3 blocked HIV-1 infection in macrophages by R5 and R5X4 viruses in a dose-dependent manner with EC (50) values of 1.7 +/- 0.6 microM and 1.85 +/- 0.75 microM, respectively. Compound 3 sustained antiretroviral activity even when added to HIV-1-infected Sup-T1 cells at 12 h after infection, suggesting that, as well as inhibiting HIV-1 RT, it also blocks HIV-1 replication at a post transcriptional step. Our results support further investigations on compound 3 pharmacokinetics and we propose that this diterpene could be considered as a potential compound for HIV-1 therapy.\",\"It has been suggested that mutations of R77A and R80A in the HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) impair its proapoptotic activity and that a naturally occurring R77Q variation is associated with non-progressive HIV-1 infection. To assess the effect of Vpr R77Q, R77A and R80A mutations on the efficiency of CCR5(R5)- and CXCR4(X4)-tropic HIV-1 replication and cytopathicity in human lymphoid tissue (HLT). Vpr mutants of the X4-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 clone and an R5-tropic derivative were generated by PCR mutagenesis. Virus stocks established by transfection of 293T cells were used to infect macrophages and ex vivo HLT. HIV-1 replication was assessed by measuring p24 core antigen in the culture supernatants and CD4 T-cell depletion and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometric analysis. The R5-tropic HIV-1 Vpr mutants replicated with slightly (R77A, R77Q) to moderately (R80A) reduced efficiency in ex vivo-infected HLT and macrophages. In comparison, the changes in Vpr had negligible effects on replication of the X4-tropic forms in lymphatic tissues. Mutation of R77Q and R80A reduced apoptosis of HIV-1-infected cells in ex vivo-infected HLT independently of the viral coreceptor tropism. However, only the R5-tropic HIV-1 Vpr mutants caused markedly less CD4 T-cell depletion than wild-type HIV-1 at the end of ex vivo HLT culture. The observation that Vpr R77Q reduces the cytopathicity of R5-tropic HIV-1 in lymphoid tissues supports a role in non-progressive HIV-1 infection but the attenuating effects might be dependent on the viral subtype and coreceptor tropism.\",\"Several innate immune mechanisms exist in mammalian cells that prevent the replication of viruses. These cellular factors influence the tropism of retroviruses in mammalian cells by inducing a dominant restriction that acts after viral entry but before integration into the host genome. The identification of several cellular factors involved with the post entry block of HIV has recently been revealed. These recent advances identified the tripartite motif protein 5alpha (Trim5alpha) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G), which work to inactivate several retroviruses including HIV-1. The mechanism of restriction by these cellular proteins is unknown. Therefore, this review highlights recent advances in understanding the function of Trim5alpha and APOBEC3G.\",\"Forty-nine recombinant viral clones between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus from the rhesus monkey (SIVmac), which carry chimeric gag (capsid/p2 region) genes in the background of the HIV-1 genome, were constructed to establish an HIV-1/monkey infection model system for human AIDS. Upon transfection, all the recombinants generated progeny virions at a level comparable to the parental HIV-1 clone and no major abnormalities were found in the virions, as examined by Western blot analysis. In infection experiments, 18 recombinants grew in human lymphocytic cells and six of these clones propagated as well as the parental virus, as monitored by virion associated-reverse transcriptase production. By contrast, none of the recombinants grew at a detectable level in monkey lymphocytic cells. The defective replication site(s) in human cells for non-infectious recombinants was mapped to the step before and/or during reverse transcription. Our results described here showed that HIV-1 type chimeric viruses between HIV-1 and SIVmac, which are capable of spreading productive infection, are readily constructed throughout the capsid/p2 region. In addition, it is suggested that there may be a viral determinant(s), other than Gag, responsible for the species-specific tropism of HIV-1 and which is associated with viral DNA synthesis.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enters cells through the chemokine receptors CCR5 (R5 virus) and/or CXCR4 (X4 virus). Loss of N-linked glycans and increased net charge of the third variable loop (V3) of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein have been observed to be important steps towards CXCR4 use. All reported sequences using CCR5 or CXCR4 exclusively, or using both, were gathered from the Los Alamos HIV Database and analysed with regard to the V3 N-linked glycosylation motifs (sequons) and charge. The V3 loop glycan had a sensitivity of 0.98 and a 0.92 positive predictive value in the context of CCR5 use. The difference from X4 was remarkable (P<10(-12)). Especially, the sequon motif NNT within the V3 loop was conserved in 99.2 % of the major clades. The results suggest a close association between the V3 loop glycan and CCR5 use and may provide new insight into HIV-1 tropism and help to improve phenotype-prediction models.\",\"The phenotype of HIV-1 gp120 envelope derived from renal epithelium and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with HIV-associated nephropathy was investigated in vitro. Chimeric viruses were derived from kidney or blood and used to infect primary CD4+T cells, cell lines expressing single co-receptors and a renal epithelial cell line HPT-1. HIV-1 variants derived from renal epithelium were dual tropic whereas simultaneously derived viruses from PBMC were R5-tropic. Utilization of alternative co-receptors CCR3, BONZO and BOB, also differed.\",\"CCR5-tropic viruses cause the vast majority of new HIV-1 infections while about half of the individuals infected with HIV-1 manifest a co-receptor switch (CCR5 (R5) to CXCR4 (X4)) prior to accelerated disease progression. The underlying biological mechanisms of X4 outgrowth in AIDS patients are still poorly understood. Although X4 viruses have been associated with increased \\\"virulence\\\" in vivo, in vitro replication and cytopathicity studies of X4 and R5 viruses have led to conflicting conclusions. We studied the replicative fitness of HIV-1 biological clones with different co-receptor tropism, isolated from four AIDS patients. On average, R5 and X4 clones replicated equally well in mitogen-activated T cells. In contrast, X4 variants were transferred more efficiently from dendritic cells to autologous CD4+ T cells. These observations suggest that interaction between X4 viruses, DC and T cells might contribute to the preferential outgrowth of X4 viruses in AIDS patients.\",\"In a meta-analysis, gene sequences of the HIV-1 V3 and surrounding envelope region from studies examining longitudinally derived blood and plasma human immunodeficiency virus forms were analyzed for changes over disease course. CD4+ counts were used as a marker of disease progression; 58 subjects, followed an average of 56 months, were included. Genetic diversification was found early in disease progression. In mid-progression (CD4+ counts dropping from 488 to 329/mm3) diversification did not increase while loop charge dramatically increased. This is consistent with a charged form that dominates and induces disease progression at this critical time. Although the overall mean increase in loop charge was significant, this increase and the transition to amino acids known to change tropism occurred in only half of the subjects who progressed. Those with rapidly progressing disease (within 2 years post-infection) began with a loop charge similar to the end stage of normal progressors. DNA from blood-cell-derived sequences differed from concurrently obtained plasma counterparts by one nucleotide out of 238, but this difference was not reflected in differences in glycosylation patterns, loop charge, or tropism-conferring amino acids. Plasma-derived forms were poorer predictors of future viral forms than were cell-derived sequences.\",\"Early human immunodeficiency virus infection is characterized by the predominance of CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. However, in many individuals CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus appears in late infection. The reasons for this phenotypic switch are unclear. The patterns of chemokine receptor expression suggest that X4 and R5 viruses have a preferential tropism for na\\u00efve and memory T cells, respectively. Since memory cells divide approximately 10 times as often as na\\u00efve cells in uninfected individuals, a tropism for memory cells in early infection may provide an advantage. However, with disease progression both na\\u00efve and memory cell division frequencies increase, and at low CD4 counts, the na\\u00efve cell division frequency approaches that of memory cells. This may provide a basis for the phenotypic switch from R5 to X4 virus observed in late infection. We show that a model of infection using observed values for cell turnover supports this mechanism. The phenotypic switch from R5 to X4 virus occurs at low CD4 counts and is accompanied by a rapid rise in viral load and drop in CD4 count. Thus, low CD4 counts are both a cause and an effect of X4 virus dominance. We also investigate the effects of different antiviral strategies. Surprisingly, these results suggest that both conventional antiretroviral regimens and CCR5 receptor-blocking drugs will promote R5 virus over X4 virus.\",\"The envelope of class I viruses can be a target for potent viral inhibitors, such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) inhibitor enfuvirtide, which are derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR2) of the transmembrane (TM) subunit. Resistance to an HR2-based peptide inhibitor of a model retrovirus, subgroup A of the Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus genus (ASLV-A), was studied by examining mutants derived by viral passage in the presence of inhibitor. Variants with reduced sensitivity to inhibitor were readily selected in vitro. Sensitivity determinants were identified for 13 different isolates, all of which mapped to the TM subunit. These determinants were identified in two regions: (i) the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) and (ii) the N-terminal segment of TM, between the subunit cleavage site and the fusion peptide. The latter class of mutants identified a region outside of the predicted HR2-binding site that can significantly alter sensitivity to inhibitor. A subset of the HR1 mutants displayed the unanticipated ability to infect nonavian cells. This expanded tropism was associated with increased efficiency of envelope triggering by soluble receptor at low temperatures, as measured by protease sensitivity of the surface subunit (SU) of envelope. In addition, expanded tropism was linked for the most readily triggered mutants with increased sensitivity to neutralization by SU-specific antiserum. These observations depict a class of HR2 peptide-selected mutations with a reduced activation threshold, thereby allowing the utilization of alternative receptors for viral entry.\",\"Despite numerous studies on the impact of viral diversity, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific immune responses and host factors on disease progression, we still do not have a firm understanding of the long-term pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. Rapid depletion of CD4+ T-lymphocytes has been associated with a switch in viral coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 in approximately 40 to 50% of infected individuals. However, the majority of infected individuals who progress to AIDS harbour only CCR5-dependent (R5) viral strains. The progression of HIV-1 disease is associated with an enhanced tropism of R5 viral strains for monocyte/macrophage lineage cells (enhanced M-tropism). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to enhanced M-tropism by R5 HIV-1 strains, and how HIV-1 variants with enhanced M-tropism cause CD4+ T-cell depletion in vivo are unknown. This review examines the relationship between viral coreceptor usage, M-tropism, and pathogenicity of HIV-1. We highlight evidence supporting the hypothesis that enhanced M-tropism of R5 HIV-1 results from adaptive viral evolution, resulting in HIV-1 variants that have increased ability to utilise relatively low levels of CCR5 expressed on macrophages, by way of increased CCR5 affinity. The evidence also suggests that these late-emerging, R5 viral strains have reduced sensitivity to entry inhibitors, and increased ability to cause CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss. These variants are likely to impact HIV-1 disease progression, especially in patients who persistently harbour only R5 viral strains.\",\"The human chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, are potential host targets for exogenous, small-molecule antagonists for the inhibition of HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 strains can be categorised by co-receptor tropism - their ability to utilise CCR5 (CCR5-tropic), CXCR4 (CXCR4-tropic) or both (dual-tropic) as a co-receptor for entry into susceptible cells. CCR5 may be the more suitable co-receptor target for small-molecule antagonists because a natural deletion in the CCR5 gene preventing its expression on the cell surface is not associated with any obvious phenotype, but can confer resistance to infection by CCR5-tropic strains - the most frequently sexually-transmitted strains. The current leading CCR5 antagonists in clinical development include maraviroc (UK-427,857, Pfizer), aplaviroc (873140, GlaxoSmithKline) and vicriviroc (SCH-D, Schering-Plough), which have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in HIV-infected patients. Pharmacodynamic data also suggest that these compounds have a long plasma half-life and/or prolonged CCR5 occupancy, which may explain the delay in viral rebound observed following compound withdrawal in short-term monotherapy studies. A switch from CCR5 to CXCR4 tropism occurs spontaneously in approximately 50% of HIV-infected patients and has been associated with, but is not required for, disease progression. The possibility of a co-receptor tropism switch occurring under selection pressure by CCR5 antagonists is discussed. The completion of ongoing Phase lib/Ill studies of maraviroc, aplaviroc and vicriviroc will provide further insight into co-receptor tropism, HIV pathogenesis and the suitability of CCR5 antagonists as a potent new class of antiyirals for the treatment of HIV infection.\",\"We previously described envelope glycoproteins of an HIV-1 isolate adapted in vitro for growth in microglia that acquired a highly fusogenic phenotype and lower CD4 dependence, as well as resistance to inhibition by anti-CD4 antibodies. Here, we investigated whether similar phenotypic changes are present in vivo. Envelope clones from the brain and spleen of an HIV-1-infected individual with neurological disease were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering of sequences according to the tissue of origin, as expected. Functional clones were then used in cell-to-cell fusion assays to test for CD4 and co-receptor utilization and for sensitivity to various antibodies and inhibitors. Both brain- and spleen-derived envelope clones mediated fusion in cells expressing both CD4 and CCR5 and brain envelopes also used CCR3 as co-receptor. We found that the brain envelopes had a lower CD4 dependence, since they efficiently mediated fusion in the presence of low levels of CD4 on the target cell membrane, and they were significantly more resistant to blocking by anti-CD4 antibodies than the spleen-derived envelopes. In contrast, we observed no difference in sensitivity to the CCR5 antagonist TAK-779. However, brain-derived envelopes were significantly more resistant than those from spleen to the fusion inhibitor T-1249 and concurrently showed slightly greater fusogenicity. Our results suggest an increased affinity for CD4 of brain-derived envelopes that may have originated from in vivo adaptation to replication in microglial cells. Interestingly, we note the presence of envelopes more resistant to a fusion inhibitor in the brain of an untreated, HIV-1-infected individual.\",\"Integrase (IN) is an essential retroviral enzyme, and human transcriptional coactivator p75, which is also referred to as lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), is the dominant cellular binding partner of HIV-1 IN. Here, we report the crystal structure of the dimeric catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN complexed to the IN-binding domain of LEDGF. Previously identified LEDGF hotspot residues anchor the protein to both monomers at the IN dimer interface. The principal structural features of IN that are recognized by the host factor are the backbone conformation of residues 168-171 from one monomer and a hydrophobic patch that is primarily comprised of alpha-helices 1 and 3 of the second IN monomer. Inspection of diverse retroviral primary and secondary sequence elements helps to explain the apparent lentiviral tropism of the LEDGF-IN interaction. Because the lethal phenotypes of HIV-1 mutant viruses unable to interact with LEDGF indicate that IN function is highly sensitive to perturbations of the structure around the LEDGF-binding site, we propose that small molecule inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction might similarly disrupt HIV-1 replication.\",\"X4 and R5 HIV strains are present in the semen of men infected with HIV but R5 isolates are transmitted preferentially. The role of human epithelial cells in this selection is addressed. Three human cervical cell lines-CaSki, SiHa, and HEC1A-and normal human vaginal cells from HIV-negative donors were characterized for HIV receptor expression and incubated with X4 and R5 laboratory-adapted strains or primary isolates. The infection was assessed by detection of intracellular HIV DNA. The three cell lines were shown to express on their surface the CXCR4 and GalCer molecules, but not the CD4 and CCR5 ones. The three cell lines and normal human vaginal cells were found to be selectively permissive to X4 HIV entry; the preincubation of the cell lines with rhSDF-1 inhibited this infection. The detection of the intracellular proviral DNA in the cell lines and in normal human vaginal cells demonstrated a selective integration of X4 strains. Additional experiments showed that no extracellular RNA was detected in the supernatants of HEC1A cells infected by X4 isolates either after 18 days of culture or after incubation with PHA-stimulated PBMCs and that no transmission occurred after co-culture between infected HEC1A cells and PHA-stimulated PBMCs. These results suggest specific sequestration of X4 strains by genital epithelial cells, which could explain, at least in part, the HIV tropism selection process during sexual intercourse.\",\"Host cell range, or tropism, combined with coreceptor usage defines viral phenotypes as macrophage tropic using CCR5 (M-R5), T-cell-line tropic using CXCR4 (T-X4), or dually lymphocyte and macrophage tropic using CXCR4 alone or in combination with CCR5 (D-X4 or D-R5X4). Although envelope gp120 V3 is necessary and sufficient for M-R5 and T-X4 phenotypes, the clarity of V3 as a dominant phenotypic determinant diminishes in the case of dualtropic viruses. We evaluated D-X4 phenotype, pathogenesis, and emergence of D-X4 viruses in vivo and mapped genetic determinants in gp120 that mediate use of CXCR4 on macrophages ex vivo. Viral quasispecies with D-X4 phenotypes were associated significantly with advanced CD4+-T-cell attrition and commingled with M-R5 or T-X4 viruses in postmortem thymic tissue and peripheral blood. A D-X4 phenotype required complex discontinuous genetic determinants in gp120, including charged and uncharged amino acids in V3, the V5 hypervariable domain, and novel V1/V2 regions distinct from prototypic M-R5 or T-X4 viruses. The D-X4 phenotype was associated with efficient use of CXCR4 and CD4 for fusion and entry but unrelated to levels of virion-associated gp120, indicating that gp120 conformation contributes to cell-specific tropism. The D-X4 phenotype describes a complex and heterogeneous class of envelopes that accumulate multiple amino acid changes along an evolutionary continuum. Unique gp120 determinants required for the use of CXCR4 on macrophages, in contrast to cells of lymphocytic lineage, can provide targets for development of novel strategies to block emergence of X4 quasispecies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.\",\"The third hypervariable (V3) loop of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 plays an essential role in the process of viral entry. It contributes to the tropism, coreceptor usage and immune-escape of the virus. We generated a monovalent plasmid DNA and demonstrated the expression of HIV-1 clade B subtype NL4-3 gp120 and gp160 in comparison to a multivalent plasmid DNA encoding for a variety of V3-variants. In contrast to the membrane-anchored gp160, preliminary data demonstrate the monovariant gp120 is expressed in and presented on a human dendritic cell (DC) line, due to a HIVenv-specific re-stimulation of na\\u00efve T-cells detected by IFNgamma-ELISPOT assay.\",\"Despite dramatic reduction of the levels of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) virions in blood and seminal plasma of infected patients, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) does not eradicate HIV-1. Three patients, with less than 50 copies/ml of plasma viral RNA, were enrolled in this eradication protocol. Didanosine (DDI) and hydroxyurea (HU) were added to their baseline HAART and after a month of therapy, low dose OKT3, followed by a 2-week course of interleukin 2 (IL-2), was administrated. All antiretroviral therapy was then interrupted and the three patients developed viral rebound in the peripheral blood. The V3 loop region of the HIV-1 gp120 from cell-free viral RNA and proviral DNA in blood and seminal compartments was sequenced in one patient. The two major viral isolates in semen cells were macrophage- tropic (R5) and dual-tropic (R5X4), and these isolates were also present in the PBMCs. Six months after the viral rebound, we demonstrated a shift toward dual tropism in semen cell-associated HIV-1 proviral DNA, with the first appearance of a T-lymphotropic (X4) provirus solely in this compartment. The virus responsible for the blood plasma viral rebound was never found in the semen microenvironment. This study suggests viral compartmentalization of the semen microenvironment after an intensification and stimulatory HIV-1 eradication protocol, with evidence of viral evolution.\",\"The Nef protein of HIV-1 is essential for its pathogenicity and is known to down-regulate MHC expression on infected cell surfaces. We now show that Nef also redistributes the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 away from the cell surface in the human monocytic U937 cell line as well as in mouse macrophages and dendritic cells. Furthermore, HIV-1-infected U937 cells and human blood-derived macrophages show a similar loss of cell surface CD80 and CD86. Nef colocalizes with MHC class I (MHCI), CD80, and CD86 in intracellular compartments, and binds to both mouse and human CD80 and CD86. Some Nef mutants defective in MHCI down-modulation, including one from a clinical isolate, remain capable of down-modulating CD80 and CD86. Nef-mediated loss of surface CD80/CD86 is functionally significant, because it leads to compromised activation of naive T cells. This novel immunomodulatory role of Nef may be of potential importance in explaining the correlations of macrophage-tropism and Nef with HIV-1 pathogenicity and immune evasion.\",\"Individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) harbor a mixture of viral variants with different sequences and in some instances with different phenotypic properties. Major and rapid fluctuations in the proportion of viral variants coexisting in an infected individual can be observed under strong pharmacological and immune selective pressure. Because of the short half-life of HIV-infected cells and of HIV virions in the blood, plasma virus populations are highly relevant to HIV evolution in the face of these selective pressures. Here we analyzed the sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization of viral variants coexisting in the plasma virus populations of two infected patients. For each patient, several replication-competent viral clones were constructed that carry primary envelope gene sequences obtained from a single plasma sample. Viral clones differed in their tropism and replicative capacity and in the number and positions of glycosylation sites in the envelope glycoproteins. Viruses were tested against heterologous and autologous sera obtained at different time points. Interestingly, we found that viral variants coexisting in each plasma sample were highly heterogeneous in terms of sensitivity to neutralization. The order of sensitivity depended on the serum used and was not associated with virus tropism. The neutralization potency of sera increased with the duration of the infection for both autologous and heterologous neutralization.\",\"With the discovery that changes in the biological properties of HIV-1 correlate with the progression to disease, it became more and more important to develop assays to distinguish between the viral phenotypes. In this chapter, it is described how the biological phenotype of HIV-1 with regard to cellular tropism can be determined on primary monocyte-derived macrophages, established T-cell lines: MT2, SupT1, and H9, and promonocytic cell lines: U937, HL-60, and THP-1.\",\"The role of coreceptors other than CCR5 and CXCR4 in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is controversial. Here we show that a promiscuous CC chemokine receptor, D6, can function as a coreceptor for various primary dual-tropic isolates of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2. Furthermore, D6 usage is common among chimeric HIV-1 constructs bearing the gp120 proteins of isolates from early seroconverting patients. D6 mRNA and immunoreactivity were demonstrated to be expressed in HIV-1 target cells such as macrophages, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and primary astrocytes. In primary astrocytes, an RNA interference-mediated knockdown of D6 expression inhibited D6-tropic isolate infection. D6 usage may account for some previous observations of alternative receptor tropism for primary human cells. Thus, D6 may be an important receptor for HIV pathogenesis in the brain and for the early dissemination of virus in the host.\",\"We identified a postentry restriction, termed Lv2, which determines the cellular tropism of two related human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) isolates and is dependent on the sequence of the capsid (CA) and envelope (Env) proteins. To explain the reliance on both CA and Env, we proposed that restrictive Envs deliver susceptible capsids to a compartment where Lv2 is active whereas nonrestrictive Envs deliver capsids into a compartment where Lv2 is either absent or less active. To test this model, we used compounds that affect endocytic pathways (ammonium chloride, bafilomycin A1, hypertonic sucrose) or lipid rafts (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) to treat restrictive cells and show that restricted virus can be rescued from Lv2 if a lipid-raft-dependent, pH-independent endocytic pathway is inhibited. Furthermore, viral entry into HeLa/CD4 cells containing a tailless CD4 receptor, located outside lipid rafts, was fully permissive. Finally, we show that a variety of primary HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses are susceptible to Lv2. Thus, we show that the route of entry, determined by the viral envelope, can influence cellular tropism by avoiding intracellular blocks to infection.\",\"The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of synthetic peptides derived from the principle neutralizing domain of the V3 loop of the HIV-1 gp120 in the infectivity rates of HIV-1 variants with different tropism. Assessment of the viral infectivity was determined by detection of soluble HIV p24gag antigen in the culture supernatants of PM-1 T cells and primary macrophages after in vitro infection with the R5, Ba-L and X4, NL4.3 variants in the presence or absence of soluble V3-derived synthetic peptides. Our results showed a clear inhibition of Ba-L infectivity in both the PM-1 T cells and primary macrophages. The degree of inhibition was related to the number of basic amino acids in the peptide. The most effective inhibitory peptide, at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, was the one with the highest cationic potential, achieving over 60% inhibition to the PM-1 T cell line and over 90% to primary macrophages. The same peptides did not affect the NL4.3 infectivity. In addition to our previously reported observations on the electrostatic nature of the V3-CCR5 interaction, we show here that V3-like peptides from the more electropositive X4 variants may be useful as effective antagonists and potential infectivity blockers of the R5 variants.\",\"We have identified two N-phenyl-N'-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-4-yl)-oxalamide analogs as a novel class of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry inhibitors that block the gp120-CD4 interaction, using database screening techniques. The lead compounds, NBD-556 and NBD-557, are small molecule organic compounds with drug-like properties. These compounds showed potent cell fusion and virus-cell fusion inhibitory activity at low micromolar levels. A systematic study showed that these compounds target viral entry by inhibiting the binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cellular receptor CD4 but did not inhibit reverse transcriptase, integrase, or protease, indicating that they do not target the later stages of the HIV-1 life cycle to inhibit HIV-1 infection. These compounds were equally potent inhibitors of both X4 and R5 viruses tested in CXCR4 and CCR5 expressing cell lines, respectively, indicating that their anti-HIV-1 activity is not dependent on the coreceptor tropism of the virus. A surface plasmon resonance study, which measures binding affinity, clearly demonstrated that these compounds bind to unliganded HIV-1 gp120 but not to the cellular receptor CD4. NBD-556 and NBD-557 were active against HIV-1 laboratory-adapted strains including an AZT-resistant strain and HIV-1 primary isolates, indicating that these compounds can potentially be further modified to become potent HIV-1 entry inhibitors.\",\"The mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of CCR5-restricted (R5) human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) strains are incompletely understood. Acquisition or enhancement of macrophage (M)-tropism by R5 viruses contributes to R5 HIV-1 pathogenesis. In this study, we show that M-tropic R5 viruses isolated from individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (late R5 viruses) require lower levels of CD4/CCR5 expression for entry, have decreased sensitivity to inhibition by the entry inhibitors TAK-779 and T-20, and have increased sensitivity to neutralization by the Env MAb IgG1b12 compared with non-M-tropic R5 viruses isolated from asymptomatic, immunocompetent individuals (early R5 viruses). Augmenting CCR5 expression levels on monocyte-derived macrophages via retroviral transduction led to a complete or marginal restoration of M-tropism by early R5 viruses, depending on the viral strain. Thus, reduced CD4/CCR5 dependence is a phenotype of R5 HIV-1 associated with M-tropism and late stage infection, which may affect the efficacy of HIV-1 entry inhibitors.\",\"Truncation of the envelope cytoplasmic tail has enabled FIV, SIV, and some laboratory HIV-1 strains to acquire broader cellular tropism and enhanced fusogenicity. Here we have characterized a primary CD4-independent HIV-1 isolate (92UG046-T8) with a truncated cytoplasmic tail that was able to infect and induce syncytia in primary lymphocytes from human, chimpanzee, and monkey, as well as CD4-negative cell lines from human and monkey. Increased syncytia were also noticeable with 293 cells expressing the cloned envelope from the 92UG046-T8 isolate suggesting envelope-mediated cellular fusion. Except pooled serum from HIV-1-infected individuals, monoclonal anti-envelope antibodies or antibodies/antagonists against CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 were not able to prevent infection by the 92UG046-T8 isolate. This is the first report showing a primary HIV-1 variant with truncated cytoplasmic tail which is highly fusogenic and can infect a broad range of cells from human and non-human origins. In vivo evolution of similar HIV-1 mutants may have important implications in AIDS pathogenesis.\",\"To determine the genetic and phenotypic composition of HIV-1 found in the choroid plexus (CPx) and its relationship to virus in the brain and peripheral lymphoid tissue. Phenotypic and molecular comparisons of HIV-1 found in autopsy brain, CPx, and spleen tissues. HIV-1 was co-cultured from matched postmortem brain (basal ganglia), CPx, and spleen tissues of AIDS patients with and without HIV-associated encephalitis and dementia. Viral phenotypes were determined by infection of monocyte-derived macrophages, MT-2 or co-receptor-specific cell lines. Viral env and pol sequences were determined from genomic DNA isolated directly from tissues or co-cultures, and phylogenetic comparisons were performed. CCR5-utilization was the most prevalent viral tropism found in all tissues, although spleen isolates also displayed CXCR4 usage. Viruses isolated from CPx consisted of both peripheral and brain-like virus, but were more related phenotypically and genetically to those found in the brain. Mutations found in the pol gene that could confer drug resistance to brain and CPx isolates were similar to those found in the periphery. The CPx contained replication-competent virus that was most similar, although distinct, from that found in the brain. It also contained some viruses with high similarity to those of peripheral origin. Compartmentalization of viral env and pol sequences indicated that differential selective pressures exist in each tissue examined. These studies suggest that the CPx may provide an environment that promotes the evolution of drug-resistant strains with central nervous system tropism, although it is unlikely to be a reservoir for archival HIV-1 variants.\",\"Infection of macrophages has been implicated as a critical event in the transmission and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we explore whether primary X4 HIV-1 isolates can productively infect tissue macrophages that have terminally differentiated in vivo. Using immunohistochemistry, HIV-1 RNA in situ hybridization, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that macrophages residing in human tonsil blocks can be productively infected ex vivo by primary X4 HIV-1 isolates. This challenges the model in which macrophage tropism is a key determinant of the selective transmission of R5 HIV-1 strains. Infection of tissue macrophages by X4 HIV-1 may be highly relevant in vivo and contribute to key events in HIV-1 pathogenesis.\",\"HIV-1 coreceptor usage plays a critical role for virus tropism and pathogenesis. A switch from CCR5 to CXCR4-using viruses can occur in the natural course of infection and correlates with subsequent disease progression. To investigate whether HIV-1 genetic evolution might lead to changes in virus coreceptor usage during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a longitudinal genotypic analysis of the virus found in cellular reservoirs was conducted in 32 patients with undetectable viral loads on HAART for 5 years. The genotype of the 3rd variable region of the env gene predicting coreceptor usage was retrospectively determined in the plasma or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline and then in PBMCs at months 30 and 60 of HAART. There was a switch from R5 to X4 variants in 11 of the 23 patients who harbored a majority virus population of R5 variants at baseline. X4 variants remained predominant in the 9 patients who harbored mainly X4 variants at baseline. The patients harboring predominantly X4 variants during HAART, either from baseline or after an R5 to X4 switch, tended to have lower CD4+ T-cell counts on HAART than did patients harboring continuously a majority population of R5 variants. These results suggest that potent antiretroviral therapy produces the conditions necessary for the gradual emergence of X4 variants in cellular reservoirs.\",\"The third variable region, V3, of the gp120 surface envelope glycoprotein is an approximately 35-residue-long, frequently glycosylated, highly variable, disulfide-bonded structure that has a major influence on HIV-1 tropism. Thus the sequence of V3, directly or indirectly, can determine which coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) is used to trigger the fusion potential of the Env complex, and hence which cells the virus can infect. V3 also influences HIV-1's sensitivity to, and ability to escape from, entry inhibitors that are being developed as antiviral drugs. For some strains, V3 is a prominent target for HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs); indeed, for many years it was considered to be the \\\"principal neutralization determinant\\\" (PND). Some efforts to use V3 as a vaccine target continue to this day, despite disappointing progress over more than a decade. Recent findings on the structure, function, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of V3 cast new doubts on the value of this vaccine approach. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of V3 as a determinant of viral tropism, and discuss how this new knowledge may inform the development of HIV-1 drugs and vaccines.\",\"CXCR4-using virus is associated with higher viral load and accelerated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression. Additionally, CCR5 antagonists may not reduce the HIV-1 RNA load when mixed/dual-tropic or CXCR4-using virus is present. The determination of coreceptor tropism may be required before CCR5 or CXCR4 antagonists are initiated, unless reliable predictive markers of coreceptor use are established. Samples from treatment-naive and -experienced HIV-1-positive individuals with date-matched CD4 and CD8 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA, clade, and pol sequences were assessed for coreceptor usage, by use of the ViroLogic PhenoSense assay. Coreceptor use determination was successful in 563 of 861 samples. Non-clade B virus was present in 18.6% of samples. CXCR4 or mixed/dual-tropic CCR5/CXCR4 virus was present in 112 of samples (19.9%). Only 4 samples (0.7%) showed exclusive CXCR4 use. In a multivariate model, higher CD4 cell count, lower viral load, and higher natural killer cell counts were significantly associated with CCR5 usage. No associations with treatment experience, clade, or pol gene mutations were observed. The prevalence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 phenotype declines with decreasing CD4 cell count and increasing viral load. Mixed/dual tropic virus is found in all CD4 cell count and viral load strata. Coreceptor usage is not influenced by viral clade.\",\"Although the primary determinant of cell tropism is the interaction of viral envelope or capsid proteins with cellular receptors, other viral elements can strongly modulate viral replication. While the HIV-1 promoter is polymorphic for a variety of transcription factor binding sites, the impact of these polymorphisms on viral replication in vivo is not known. To address this issue, we engineered isogenic SIVmac239 chimeras harboring the core promoter/enhancer from HIV-1 clades B, C, and E. Here it is shown that the clade C and E core promoters/enhancers bear a noncanonical activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site, absent from the corresponding clade B region. Relative ex vivo replication of chimeras was strongly dependent on the tissue culture system used. Notably, in thymic histocultures, replication of the clade C chimera was favored by IL-7 enrichment, which suggests that the clade C polymorphism in the AP-1 and NF-kappaB binding sites is involved. Simultaneous infection of rhesus macaques with the 3 chimeras revealed a strong predominance of the clade C chimera during primary infection. Thereafter, the B chimera dominated in all tissues. These data show that the clade C promoter is particularly adapted to sustain viral replication in primary viremia and that clade-specific promoter polymorphisms constitute a major determinant for viral replication.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the male genital tract may comprise virus produced locally in addition to virus transported from the circulation. Virus produced in the male genital tract may be genetically distinct, due to tissue-specific cellular characteristics and immunological pressures. HIV-1 env sequences derived from paired blood and semen samples from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database were analyzed to ascertain a male genital tract-specific viral signature. Machine learning algorithms could predict seminal tropism based on env sequences with accuracies exceeding 90%, suggesting that a strong genetic signature does exist for virus replicating in the male genital tract. Additionally, semen-derived viral populations exhibited constrained diversity (P < 0.05), decreased levels of positive selection (P < 0.025), decreased CXCR4 coreceptor utilization, and altered glycosylation patterns. Our analysis suggests that the male genital tract represents a distinct selective environment that contributes to the apparent genetic bottlenecks associated with the sexual transmission of HIV-1.\",\"HIV entry into cells is mediated through sequential interactions between HIV envelope proteins (Env) and two cellular molecules: CD4 and a co-receptor, typically either CCR5 or CXCR4. Co-receptor preference has been associated with other viral traits; specifically, CXCR4-tropic viruses have been associated with increased host cell pathogenicity and more rapid progression of disease. Recently, much attention has been focused on the development of CCR5 and CXCR4 antagonists as antiviral agents and several are set to enter phase III trials in 2004 and 2005. The development of assays to assess the co-receptor tropism of HIV populations is critical for the optimal design and performance of clinical trials to evaluate these agents. In addition, the use of these agents in a clinical setting is likely to benefit from a reliable methodology for tropism determination prior to the selection of an optimal antiviral therapy or to evaluate continued efficacy of a regimen. Tropism assays that use recombinant viruses and pseudotyped HIV are becoming more commonly employed and comparative data with standard assays have begun to be accumulated. These assays are being used to expand on earlier studies of the epidemiology and natural history of HIV tropism. In addition, tropism assays have facilitated the study of co-receptor inhibitors in vitro and in phase I and II trials. The development of rapid, reliable tropism assays has been useful in advancing the development of novel antiviral agents. Defining the role of these assays in routine clinical practice will be the next important step.\",\"Despite numerous studies on the impact of viral diversity, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific immune responses and host factors on disease progression, we still do not have a firm understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. Rapid depletion of CD4+ T-lymphocytes has been associated with a switch in viral coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 in approximately 40 to 50% of infected individuals. However, the majority of infected individuals who progress to AIDS harbor only CCR5-dependent (R5) viral strains. HIV-1 disease progression is associated with an enhanced tropism of R5 viral strains for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (enhanced M-tropism). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to enhanced M-tropism by R5 HIV-1 strains, and how HIV-1 variants with enhanced M-tropism cause CD4+ T-cell depletion in vivo are unknown. This review examines the relationship between viral coreceptor usage, M-tropism, and pathogenicity of HIV-1. We highlight evidence supporting the hypothesis that enhanced M-tropism of R5 HIV-1 results from adaptive viral evolution, resulting in HIV-1 variants that have increased ability to utilize relatively low levels of CD4 and CCR5 expressed on macrophages. The evidence also suggests that these late-emerging, R5 viral strains have reduced sensitivity to entry inhibitors, and increased ability to cause CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss. These variants are likely to impact HIV-1 disease progression, particularly in patients who persistently harbor only R5 viral strains.\",\"The aim of our investigation was to study the HIV-1 env V3 loop sequences of the subtype A variant of the virus actively circulating in the territory of Eastern Europe (A1-EE). It appears that the characteristics of HIV-1 V3 loop sequences of the thoroughly studied subtype B strains determine the viruses tropism and phenotype. We were interested to find out to what extent these trends are preserved with the subtype A isolates spread in Eastern Europe. About 474 HIV-1 strains were isolated by cocultivation with phytohemagglutinin stimulated and interleukin-2 activated PBMC. Isolates were subtyped after distinct regions gag, pol and env were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction. V3 sequences were studied in detail and compared with the isolates that appeared as SI or NSI in test-cultures MT-2. The subtype A HIV-1 strains spread in Eastern Europe appeared to have V3 loop sequences with a high level of conservatism. The consensus sequences of the SI and NSI isolates proved identical, and correspond to the phenotype markers of subtype B NSI strains. Nevertheless, the subtype A SI isolates induced active syncytium-formation processes in the MT-2 test culture. The data obtained evidenced to the following: the HIV-1 subtype A variant spread in Eastern Europe, is capable of using for interaction with receptor structures of sensitive cells the tools and mechanisms, which are significantly different from those described for subtype B.\",\"HIV-1, like the other lentiviruses, has evolved the ability to infect nondividing cells including macrophages. HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages entails peculiar features and differs in many respects from that in CD4 T lymphocytes. HIV-1 exhibits different tropism for CD4 T cells and macrophages. The virus can enter macrophages via several routes. Mitosis is not required for nuclear import of viral DNA or for its integration into the host cell genome. Specific cellular factors are required for HIV-1 transcription in macrophages. The assembly and budding of viral particles in macrophages take place in late endosomal compartments. Viral particles can use the exosome pathway to exit cells. Given their functions in host defence against pathogens and the regulation of the immune response plus their permissivity to HIV-1 infection, monocytes/macrophages exert a dual role in HIV infection. They contribute to the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection, and may activate surrounding T cells favouring their infection. Furthermore, monocytes/macrophages act as a Trojan horse to transmit HIV-1 to the central nervous system. They also exhibit antiviral activity and express many molecules that inhibit HIV-1 replication. Activated microglia and macrophages may also exert a neurotrophic and neuroprotective effect on infected brain regulating glutamate metabolism or by secretion of neurotrophins. This review will discuss specific aspects of viral replication in monocytes/macrophages and the role of their interactions with the cellular environment in HIV-1 infection swinging between protection and pathogenesis.\",\"Capsid (CA)-specific restrictions are determinants of retroviral tropism in mammalian cells. One such restriction, human Ref1, targets strains of murine leukemia virus bearing an arginine at CA residue 110 (N-MLV), resulting in decreased accumulation of viral cDNA. The cellular factors accounting for Ref1 activity are unknown. As(2)O(3) increases N-MLV titer in Ref1-positive cells, possibly by counteracting Ref1. Restriction factor saturation experiments suggest that Ref1 may also target human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but only if its CA is not bound to the cellular protein cyclophilin A (CypA). As a step towards understanding the genetic determinants of Ref1, we subjected Ref1-positive TE671 cells to three sequential rounds of selection with N-MLV reporter viruses. We isolated a subclone, 17H1, that was permissive for N-MLV infection and therefore deficient in Ref1 activity. Stimulation of N-MLV replication by As(2)O(3) was attenuated in 17H1, confirming that the drug acts by overcoming Ref1 activity. HIV-1 infection of 17H1 cells was resistant to disruption of the CA-CypA interaction, demonstrating that Ref1 restricts CypA-free HIV-1. Our results suggest that interaction with CypA evolved to protect HIV-1 from this human antiviral activity.\",\"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lymphocyte P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and genotype in vivo and the expression of lymphocyte receptors critical in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), i.e., CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Using flow cytometry to quantify each membrane receptor/transporter, we demonstrate a highly significant correlation between P-gp protein expression and the expression of CXCR4 (rho = 0.874; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed colocalized expression of CXCR4 and P-gp in the lymphocyte membrane. This significant relationship was also apparent at the mRNA level by use of reverse transcription-PCR (rho = 0.61; P < 0.005) and was present in both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotypic analysis of the C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphism of P-gp confirmed significantly higher levels of P-gp in C (range, 2.45 to 11.00 relative fluorescence units [RFU])- than in T (range, 0.25 to 5.00 RFU)-homozygous individuals (P = 0.0088; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7 to 6.3 RFU). An equivalent association between CXCR4 levels and C (range, 12.7 to 44.1 RFU) versus T (range, 3 to 18.9 RFU) genotype was also demonstrated (P = 0.0019; 95% CI, 5.4 to 23.7). Functionally, although these correlates had no impact on HIV-1 production from either X4- or R5-tropic virus, expression correlated significantly with the activity of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) saquinavir for both P-gp (rho = 0.75; P = 0.0019) and CXCR4 (rho = 0.71; P = 0.0041). This study defines an association between P-gp (expression and genotype) and CXCR4 that may have implications for the selection of viral tropism and the access of drugs to protease for specific tropic types. The interplay between these two proteins may also influence the viral genotypes which escape effective chemotherapy and which therefore have the opportunity to evolve resistance to PIs.\",\"The tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 for chemokine receptors plays an important role in the transmission of AIDS. Although CXCR4-tropic virus is more cytopathic for T cells, CCR5-tropic strains are transmitted more frequently in humans for reasons that are not understood. Phenotypically immature myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) are preferentially infected by CCR5-tropic virus, in contrast to mature mDCs, which are not susceptible to infection but instead internalize virus into a protected intracellular compartment and enhance the infection of T cells. Here, we define a mechanism to explain preferential transmission of CCR5-tropic viruses based on their interaction with mDCs and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Infected immature mDCs differentiated normally and were found to enhance CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic virus infection of T cells even in the continuous presence of neutralizing antibodies. Infectious synapses also formed normally in the presence of such antibodies. Infection of immature mDCs by CCR5-tropic virus can therefore establish a pool of infected cells that can efficiently transfer virus at the same time that they protect virus from antibody neutralization. This property of DCs may enhance infection, contribute to immune evasion, and could provide a selective advantage for CCR5-tropic virus transmission.\",\"The narrow host range of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is due in part to dominant acting restriction factors in humans (Ref1) and monkeys (Lv1). Here we show that gag encodes determinants of species-specific lentiviral infection, related in part to such restriction factors. Interaction between capsid and host cyclophilin A (CypA) protects HIV-1 from restriction in human cells but is essential for maximal restriction in simian cells. We show that sequence variation between HIV-1 isolates leads to variation in sensitivity to restriction factors in human and simian cells. We present further evidence for the importance of target cell CypA over CypA packaged in virions, specifically in the context of gp160 pseudotyped HIV-1 vectors. We also show that sensitivity to restriction is controlled by an H87Q mutation in the capsid, implicated in the immune control of HIV-1, possibly linking immune and innate control of HIV-1 infection.\",\"Retroviruses utilize cellular dNTPs to perform proviral DNA synthesis in infected host cells. Unlike oncoretroviruses, which replicate in dividing cells, lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus, are capable of efficiently replicating in non-dividing cells (terminally differentiated macrophages) as well as dividing cells (i.e. activated CD4+ T cells). In general, non-dividing cells are likely to have low cellular dNTP content compared with dividing cells. Here, by employing a novel assay for cellular dNTP content, we determined the dNTP concentrations in two HIV-1 target cells, macrophages and activated CD4+ T cells. We found that human macrophages contained 130-250-fold lower dNTP concentrations than activated human CD4+ T cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that, unlike oncoretroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs), lentiviral RTs efficiently synthesize DNA even in the presence of the low dNTP concentrations equivalent to those found in macrophages. In keeping with this observation, HIV-1 vectors containing mutant HIV-1 RTs, which kinetically mimic oncoretroviral RTs, failed to transduce human macrophages despite retaining normal infectivity for activated CD4+ T cells and other dividing cells. These results suggest that the ability of HIV-1 to infect macrophages, which is essential to establishing the early pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, depends, at least in part, on enzymatic adaptation of HIV-1 RT to efficiently catalyze DNA synthesis in limited cellular dNTP substrate environments.\",\"During HIV-1 infection or vaccination, HIV-1 envelope spikes elicit Ab responses. Neutralizing Abs block viral entry by recognizing epitopes on spikes critical for their interaction with receptor, coreceptors or fusion. In contrast, nonneutralizing Abs fail to do so because they recognize epitopes either buried or exposed but not critical for viral entry. Previously, we produced a high-affinity human mAb against the cluster II determinant of gp41. This Ab or its recombinant Fab and single-chain Fv have been repeatedly shown to bind to HIV-1 gp160 or gp41, but fail to block viral entry. We report that, surprisingly, expression of this nonneutralizing anti-HIV-1 gp41 single-chain Fv on the surface of human CD4 T cells markedly inhibits HIV-1 replication and cell-cell fusion. The inhibition targets the HIV-1 envelope at the level of viral entry, regardless of HIV-1 tropism. Although this bona fide nonneutralizing Ab does not neutralize HIV-1 entry when produced as a soluble protein, it acts as a neutralizing Ab when expressed on the cell surface. Expressing Abs on the surface of HIV-1-susceptible cells can be a new way to fight HIV-1.\",\"Evolution of the HIV-1 V3 loop was monitored in 15 subjects over a period of 5 years at approximately 6-month intervals. Putative recombination was detected in many of the sequences. Evolutionary trees were estimated from the nonrecombinant viral sequences found in each individual. Selection and altered demographic regimes were detected with logit and other contingency analyses in a highly context-dependent fashion. Mutations leading to amino acid substitutions are subject to positive selection over a broad range of clinical conditions in the nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) form, and the growth rates of the NSI strains and their level of genetic subdivision change little in going from a healthy immune system to a severely compromised immune system. In contrast, the SI form has a significant increase in growth rate as the immune system goes from healthy to compromised, particularly in those subjects who did not receive any antiviral drug therapy. This increase in SI growth rate results in a significant growth advantage of SI over NSI when the immune system is compromised. The SI strains also show more demographic subdivision when the immune system is healthy than when the immune system is compromised, and the SI form has greater demographic subdivision than NSI in subjects with healthy immune systems who also are not receiving antiviral drug therapy. Positive selection on amino-acid-changing mutations weakens and then intensifies again in the SI strains in going from healthy to compromised immune systems. These patterns are consistent with other studies that suggest that NSI strains inhibit replication of SI strains, that the V3 loop is more hidden from the immune system in the NSI form, that evolution in the V3 loop influences cell tropism and coreceptor usage, that substrate for replication of SI forms increases as the disease progresses, and that death of CD8 cells is influenced by the type of coreceptor usage typically found in SI but not in NSI strains. Finally, the transition between NSI and SI forms is associated with a burst of evolutionary change due to strong positive selection at sites other than those that define the NSI/SI phenotypes.\",\"Disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals is frequently accompanied by declining CD4 cell numbers and the acquisition of a T-tropic (X4) or dual tropic (R5X4) phenotype. Understanding the mechanism of CD4 cell loss in HIV-1 infection is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, donor populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were selected for their ability to support an equivalent acute infection by both R5 and X4 virus phenotypes. This demonstrated that CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss was due to the gp120 region of Env and was replication independent. Furthermore, apoptosis was only detected in cells infected with an X4 virus after the majority of CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss had occurred. These observations indicate that the CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss in an X4 HIV-1 infection is not directly mediated by apoptosis, although apoptosis may be induced in the remaining cell population as a consequence of this CD4+ T-lymphocyte loss.\",\"It is well known that HIV-1 does not establish infection in nonhuman primates, nor in cell lines derived from them, due to the existence of saturable resistance factors. In this study, we show that an in vitro established Macaca fascicularis-derived CD4(-) B cell line (F6) can be productively infected by the laboratory-adapted T-tropic HXBc2/HIV-1 strain at low multiplicity of infection, apparently because it does not express the restriction factor that has been detected in other simian cell lines. Moreover, efficient entry into F6 cells was obtained with pseudotyped recombinant HIV-1 viruses containing the laboratory-adapted T-tropic (HXBc2) or the dual-tropic (89.6) envelope glycoproteins, whereas entry of virus containing the envelope glycoproteins of the M-tropic Ba-L strain was less efficient. Virus containing primary T-tropic (Eli) envelope glycoproteins did not infect F6 cells. Furthermore, although CCR5 was not present on the cell surface and gpr15 and strl33 mRNAs were not expressed in the cells, a high level of infection of F6 cells by the M-tropic simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac316 was observed. In contrast, F6 cells were poorly infected by T-tropic SIVmac239. Given the unique properties of the F6 cell line, i.e., that it is of simian origin yet is able to be infected by HIV-1 in a CD4-independent manner, F6 cells represent a useful model for studying cellular factors mediating resistance or permissivity to HIV-1 infection and may help to evaluate HIV-1 and SIV cell tropism.\",\"We recently reported that retroviral pseudotypes bearing the hepatitis C virus (HCV) strain H and Con1 glycoproteins, genotype 1a and 1b, respectively, require CD81 as a coreceptor for virus-cell entry and infection. Soluble truncated E2 cloned from a number of diverse HCV genotypes fail to interact with CD81, suggesting that viruses of diverse origin may utilize different receptors and display altered cell tropism. We have used the pseudotyping system to study the tropism of viruses bearing diverse HCV glycoproteins. Viruses bearing these glycoproteins showed a 150-fold range in infectivity for hepatoma cells and failed to infect lymphoid cells. The level of glycoprotein incorporation into particles varied considerably between strains, generally reflecting the E2 expression level within transfected cells. However, differences in glycoprotein incorporation were not associated with virus infectivity, suggesting that infectivity is not limited by the absolute level of glycoprotein. All HCV pseudotypes failed to infect HepG2 cells and yet infected the same cells after transduction to express human CD81, confirming the critical role of CD81 in HCV infection. Interestingly, these HCV pseudotypes differed in their ability to infect HepG2 cells expressing a panel of CD81 variants, suggesting subtle differences in the interaction of CD81 residues with diverse viral glycoproteins. Our current model of HCV infection suggests that CD81, together with additional unknown liver specific receptor(s), mediate the virus-cell entry process.\",\"The outcome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is related to the set-point plasma virus load (pVL) that emerges after primary HIV-1 infection (PHI). This set-point pVL generally remains stable but eventually increases with progression to disease. However, the events leading to loss of viremic control are poorly understood. Here, we describe an individual who presented with symptomatic PHI and subsequently progressed rapidly, after an initial period of 1 year during which viral replication was well controlled. Escalation of viral replication in this atypical case was preceded by the emergence of escape variants in many epitopes targeted by dominant CD8+ T cell responses and a marked decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies. There were no changes in viral tropism, replication kinetics, or neutralizing antibody titers. These findings demonstrate the temporal relationship between viral escape from CD8+ T cell activity, decrease in HIV-1-specific T cell frequencies, and loss of control of viral replication.\",\"The use of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) by X4 and R5 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelopes (Env) influences HIV cytopathicity. Here, we have evaluated the role of CCR5 and gp41 in Env-induced cell death occurring during the contacts of uninfected, primary cells with MOLT cells infected with different R5 and X4 HIV isolates. As reported for X4-Env, R5 HIV-infected cells destroyed CD4 T cells expressing the appropriate coreceptor by inducing the formation of syncytia and the death of single target cells. Therefore, only the small (<10%) CCR5+ subset of primary CD4 T cells was sensitive to cellular presentation of R5-Env, and CCR5-CD4 T cells showed complete resistance to R5-Env-mediated cell death. X4- and R5-infected cells killed single primary cells by a common mechanism that was dependent on gp41 function and induced a rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and plasma membrane integrity in target cells. Single-cell death was not affected by the blockade of HIV replication in target cells or G-protein signaling through CXCR4/CCR5. In contrast, caspase inhibition (Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone) profoundly changed the outcome of cell-to-cell contacts by reducing the number of single dead CD4 T cells and increasing the rate of syncytium formation. In conclusion, X4 and R5 HIV Env share a common gp41-dependent mechanism to kill CD4 T cells during cellular contacts. Env tropism and coreceptor expression but not differential killing mechanisms seem to govern the extent of cytopathic effects induced by HIV infection.\",\"CD4+ T lymphocytes are the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but there is increasing evidence that other immune cells in the blood, including CD8+ T lymphocytes and monocytes, are also productively infected. The extent to which these additional cellular reservoirs contribute to ongoing immunodeficiency and viral persistence during therapy remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation of HIV-1 diversity and genetic structure in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes of 13 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Analysis of molecular variance and nonparametric tests performed on HIV-1 envelope sequences provided statistically significant evidence of viral compartmentalization in different leukocyte populations. Signature pattern analysis and predictions of coreceptor use provided no evidence that selection arising from viral tropism was responsible for the genetic structure observed. Analysis of viral genetic variation in different leukocyte populations demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. In the absence of evidence for leukocyte-specific selection, these features were supportive of a metapopulation model of HIV-1 replication as described previously among HIV-1 populations in the spleen. Compartmentalization of the virus in different leukocytes may have significant implications for current models of HIV-1 population genetics and contribute to the highly variable way in which drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART.\",\"Complete envelope genes were amplified from autopsy brain tissue of five individuals who had died of AIDS and had neurological complications. Lymph node samples were included for two of the patients. Nineteen different envelope clones from the five patients had distinct V1V2 sequences. Thirteen of the envelopes were functional and conferred fusigenicity and infectivity for CD4(+) CCR5(+) cells. Infectivity and cell-cell fusion assays showed that most envelopes used both CCR5 and CCR3. One brain-derived envelope used a broad range of coreceptors, while three other brain envelopes from one individual were restricted to CCR5. However, there was no correlation between tissue of origin and coreceptor use. Envelopes showed two very distinct phenotypes depending on their capacity to infect macrophages and to exploit low levels of CD4 and/or CCR5 for infection. Envelopes that were highly fusigenic and tropic for macrophages were identified in brain tissue from four of the five patients. The enhanced macrophage tropism correlated with reduced sensitivity to inhibition by Q4120, a CD4-specific antibody, but not with sensitivity to the CCR5 inhibitor, TAK779. The highly macrophage-tropic envelopes were able to infect cells expressing low levels of CD4 and/or CCR5. Comparison with several well-characterized macrophage-tropic envelopes showed that the four identified patient envelopes were at the top limit of macrophage tropism. In contrast, all four lymph node-derived envelopes exhibited a non-macrophage-tropic phenotype and required high levels of CD4 for infection. Our data support the presence of envelopes that are highly fusigenic and tropic for macrophages in the brains of patients with neurological complications. These envelopes are able to infect cells that express low levels of CD4 and/or CCR5 and may have adapted for replication in brain macrophages and microglia, which are known to express limited amounts of CD4.\",\"We present preclinical studies that demonstrate in vitro the feasibility and efficacy of lentivirus-based vector antisense gene therapy for control of HIV replication in primary T lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected patients discordant for clinical status. VRX496 is a VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-based vector that encodes an antisense payload against the HIV envelope gene. The antisense payload is under the control of the native LTR promoter, which is highly transactivated by tat upon HIV infection in the cell. Transfer of autologous CD4(+) T lymphocytes genetically modified with VRX496 (VRX496T) into HIV-infected patients is intended to provide a reservoir of cells capable of controlling HIV, potentially delaying AIDS onset. To determine the patient population likely to respond to VRX496 for optimal efficacy, we examined the ability of our research vector, VRX494, to modify and suppress HIV in vitro in lymphocytes isolated from 20 study subjects discordant for CD4 count and viral load. VRX494 is analogous to the clinical vector VRX496, except that it contains GFP as a marker gene instead of the 186-tag marker in the clinical vector. To transfer VRX494 to target cells we developed a novel scalable two-step transduction procedure that has been translated to the clinic in an ongoing clinical trial. This procedure achieved unprecedented transduction efficiencies of 94 +/- 5% in HIV(+) study subject cells. In addition the vector inhibited HIV replication >/=93% in culture regardless of the viral load or CD4 count of the subject or tropism of the virus strain with which they were infected. These findings demonstrate that VRX496T therapy is expected to be beneficial to patients that differ in their status in term of CD4 count and viral load. The methods described represent significant technical advances facilitating execution of lentivirus vector-mediated gene therapy for treatment of HIV and are currently being employed in the first trial evaluating lentivirus vector safety in humans.\",\"Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed T-lymphocytes are permissive for both X4 and R5 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). HVS-encoded proteins tyrosine-kinase interacting protein (Tip) and saimiri transformation-associated protein subgroup C (StpC) were previously implicated in altering HIV permissiveness. MOLT4 cells expressing StpC or StpC and Tip are permissive for X4 strains of HIV-1. In contrast, HIV-1 was restricted in MOLT4 cells expressing Tip alone. Here we show that MOLT4 cells and primary lymphocytes expressing StpC are permissive for R5 strains of HIV-1 while Tip expression restricted R5 strains. These results suggest that intracellular immunization with Tip and StpC could be developed as models for therapeutic strategies targeting both X4 and R5 strains of HIV-1.\",\"It is unclear whether resistance to immunologic damage in long-term non-progressors (LTNP) will last indefinitely or whether it merely represents the extreme of a Gaussian distribution, and therefore progression will occur eventually. A cohort of 19 LTNP was established in 1997. Plasma viraemia and CD4 cell counts were measured two to three times each year until 2003. Analyses of nef and vpr viral genes, CCR5 genotypes, co-receptor tropism, viral replication capacity, and immunological parameters were performed. Twelve subjects (non-progressors, NP) showed stable CD4 cell counts over the 6-year follow-up, while seven (slow progressors, SP) showed a trend towards progressive CD4 cell depletion; however, only three SP experienced significant CD4 cell count declines. All SP had detectable plasma HIV-RNA (median 1118 copies/ml). In contrast, five of 12 NP had always undetectable viraemia. Only one patient showed a deletion in nef. The vpr R77Q change was recognized in seven patients. All patients were infected with R5 viruses. The virus replicative capacity was reduced in all tested individuals (range 5-93%). None of the patients was homozygous for the delta-32 CCR5 genotype, which was found in heterozygosis in three. CD8 T-cell activation was low in all but three individuals, all of whom had detectable viraemia and showed progressive CD4 cell depletion. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses were similar to those found in a control group of HIV progressors. A substantial proportion of LTNP show low-level virus replication and progressive loss of CD4 T cells over time. Progressive immunologic damage seems to be directly associated with some degree of virus replication and T-cell activation.\",\"Retroviral tropism is determined in part by cellular restriction factors that block infection by targeting the incoming viral capsid. Indeed, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of many nonhuman primate cells is inhibited by one such factor, termed Lv1. In contrast, a restriction factor in humans, termed Ref1, does not inhibit HIV-1 infection unless nonnatural mutations are introduced into the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA). Here, we examined the infectivity of a panel of mutant HIV-1 strains carrying substitutions in the N-terminal CA domain in cells that exhibit restriction attributable to Lv1 or Ref1. Manipulation of HIV-1 CA could alter HIV-1 tropism, and several mutations were identified that increased or decreased HIV-1 infectivity in a target-cell-specific manner. Many residues that affected HIV-1 tropism were located in the three variable loops that lie on the outer surface of the modeled HIV-1 conical capsid. Some tropism determinants, including the CypA binding site, coincided with residues whose mutation conferred on HIV-1 CA the ability to saturate Ref1 in human cells. Notably, a mutation that reverses the infectivity defect in human cells induced by CypA binding site mutation inhibits recognition by Ref1. Overall, these findings demonstrate that exposed variable loops in CA and a partial CypA \\\"coat\\\" can modulate restriction and HIV-1 tropism and suggest a model in which the exposed surface of the incoming retroviral capsid is the target for inhibition by host cell-specific restriction factors.\",\"NaN\",\"In addition to the CD4 molecule that binds to the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120, productive HIV-1 infection requires interaction with cellular receptors for alpha- or beta- chemokines (CXCR4 and CCR5 respectively). Isolates of HIV-1 exhibit different tropism depending on the chemokine receptor type that they use to infect their cellular targets. HIV-1 strains that use preferentially CCR5 are known as R5 strains. They are more frequently found in asymptomatic individuals during the initial stages of the disease and are involved in the transmision of infection from mother to child. HIV-1 species using CXCR4 (X4 strains) are observed mainly in patients with advanced disease. While X4 isolates are associated with syncitium formation, in general R5 strains are not. Interaction of X4 and R5 with their specific receptors is necessary to establish productive HIV-1 infection and trigger a series of intracellular signals. Modulation of CXCR4 and CCR5 expression after HIV-1 infection is one of the results of such interaction and may have important consequences on the course of the infection. Down regulation of CCR5 and CXCR4 after HIV-1 infection could be the result of indirect events linked to HIV-1 infection, such as the induction of alpha- or beta-chemokines competing with the virions for receptor binding. They could also reflect direct effects of HIV-1 on chemokine-receptor turnover. In this review, the mechanisms of modulation of CXCR4 and CCR5 expression after HIV-1 infection will be discussed.\",\"Although the B clade of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelopes (Env) includes five highly variable regions, each of these domains contains a subset of sequences that remain conserved. The V3 loop has been much studied for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies, which are often restricted to a limited number of closely related strains, likely because a large number of antigenic structures are generated from the diverse amino acid sequences in this region. Despite these strain-specific determinants, subregions of V3 are highly conserved, and the effects of different portions of the V3 loop on Env tropism and immunogenicity have not been well delineated. For this report, selective deletions in V3 were introduced by shortening of the stem of the V3 loop. These mutations were explored in combination with deletions of selected V regions. Progressive shortening of the stem of V3 abolished the immunogenicity as well as the functional activity of HIV Env; however, two small deletions on both arms of the V3 stem altered the tropism of the dualtropic 89.6P viral strain so that it infected only CXCR4(+) cells. When this smaller deletion was combined with removal of the V1 and V2 loops and used as an immunogen in guinea pigs, the antisera were able to neutralize multiple independent clade B isolates with a higher potency. These findings suggest that highly conserved subregions within V3 may be relevant targets for eliciting neutralizing antibody responses, affecting HIV tropism, and increasing the immunogenicity of AIDS vaccines.\",\"In this review, we will discuss what is known, what is suspected, and what still remains obscure about the central role played by coreceptor expression and usage in the transmission and pathogenic consequences of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. An emphasis will be on the HIV-1 phenotypic variants that are defined by their usage of the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors, and how the different cellular tropism of these variants influences how and where HIV-1 replicates in vivo. We will also review what might happen when coreceptor antagonists are used clinically to treat HIV-1 infection.\",\"The HIV type 1 (HIV-1) virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein blocks the action of the host defense factor APOBEC3G in human cells, thereby allowing release of infectious virions, but fails to inhibit similar APOBEC3G proteins present in some simian cells. Conversely, the Vif protein encoded by the African green monkey (agm) simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can block agm APOBEC3G function but fails to inhibit human APOBEC3G. This difference plays a key role in determining the primate species tropism of HIV-1 and SIV agm. Here, we demonstrate that a single APOBEC3G residue, which is an aspartic acid in human APOBEC3G and a lysine in agm APOBEC3G, controls the ability of the HIV-1 Vif protein to bind and inactivate these host defense factors. These data identify a critical charged residue that plays a key role in mediating the formation of the distinct Vif:APOBEC3G complexes formed in human and simian cells. Moreover, these results suggest that the biological barrier preventing the entry of additional SIV into the human population as zoonotic infections is potentially quite fragile.\",\"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare disorder caused by endothelial cell damage. TMA has been associated with the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, yet only a minority of all HIV-1 patients develops TMA. Since HIV-1 has been shown to interact with endothelial cells, we investigated whether certain mutations in the HIV-1 envelope protein are associated with the development of TMA in HIV-1-infected patients. Plasma was obtained from nine HIV-1-positive patients with TMA. Viral loads were determined from the samples and compared with the clinical data. Viral envelope protein sequences from the regions known to be responsible for viral tropism were isolated, sequenced and compared with known HIV-1 isolates. The isolates were expressed as synthetic fusion proteins; binding of these fusion proteins to CD4+ cells as well as to endothelial cell lines was investigated. The viral loads in patients with HIV/TMA were highly variable with no correlation to the clinical status. Most patients carried macrophage-tropic viral envelope protein sequences and an unusual insertion was found in the V2 variable region. The isolates showed increased CD4 binding, but a direct binding to endothelial cells was not observed. Although TMA is generally diagnosed in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, viral loads per se were not predictive of TMA in this study. While a direct interaction with endothelial cells was not detectable, specific viral envelope mutations were found in a region known to influence viral tropism. Hence, viral-specific factors might contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated TMA.\",\"For more than two decades, retroviral biology has been the most intensely studied field in virology. The retroviral genome is encoded by a 7-11 kb positivesense single-stranded RNA molecule, two of which homodimerize and package in lipid-enveloped viral particles. Following attachment and receptor-mediated entry into host cells, viral reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes mediate reverse transcription and integration of the virus genome into the host-cell chromatin. The ability of a replication competent retrovirus to incorporate a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene into the genome of a mouse cell and to convert NIH-3T3 TK- cells into TK+ transformants was first described in 1981 (1,2). These studies established the basis of using retroviruses as vehicles for efficient therapeutic gene delivery into mammalian cells. Twenty years of extensive research of retrovirus-vector biology resulted in major improvements in vector design and retrovirus-vector production. High-titer concentrated retrovirus vectors (>10(9) infectious units [IU]/mL) can be generated by several retrovirusvector stable producer lines. The ability to pseudotype retrovirus vectors with a variety of envelope proteins, including the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G), significantly broadens the tropism of replication-defective retrovirus vectors.\",\"APOBEC3G (also known as CEM15) is an innate intracellular antiretroviral factor that is counteracted by the Vif protein of lentiviruses. While APOBEC3G orthologues from several species are active against a broad range of retroviruses, given Vif proteins have a narrow spectrum of activity. For instance, HIV-1 Vif efficiently blocks APOBEC3G from human but not African green monkey (AGM), whereas the reverse is observed with SIV(AGM) Vif. Here, we demonstrate that a single amino acid at position 128 of human and AGM APOBEC3G governs the virus-specific sensitivity of these proteins to Vif-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, we show that this phenotype correlates with the ability of Vif to bind APOBEC3G and interfere with its incorporation into virions. These results shed light on an important determinant of the tropism of primate lentiviruses.\",\"The envelope glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) has been used extensively to pseudotype lentiviral vectors, but has several drawbacks including cytotoxicity, potential for priming of immune responses against transgene products through efficient transduction of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and sensitivity to inactivation by human complement. As an alternative to VSV-G, we extensively characterized lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the gp64 envelope glycoprotein from baculovirus both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated for the first time that gp64-pseudotyped vectors could be delivered efficiently in vivo in mice via portal vein injection. Following delivery, the efficiency of mouse cell transduction and the transgene expression is comparable to VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors. In addition, we found that gp64-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors could efficiently transduce a variety of cell lines in vitro, although gp64 showed a more restricted tropism than VSV-G, with especially poor ability to transduce hematopoietic cell types including dendritic cells (DCs). Although we found that gp64-pseudotyped vectors are also sensitive to inactivation by human complement, gp64 nevertheless has advantages over VSV-G, because of its lack of cytotoxicity and narrower tropism. Consequently, gp64 is an attractive alternative to VSV-G because it can efficiently transduce cells in vivo and may reduce immune responses against the transgene product or viral vector by avoiding transduction of APCs such as DCs.\",\"CD81 has been described as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV); however, its role in HCV cell entry has not been characterized due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system. We have examined the role of CD81 in HCV glycoprotein-dependent entry by using a recently developed retroviral pseudotyping system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotypes bearing HCV E1E2 glycoproteins show a restricted tropism for human liver cell lines. Although all of the permissive cell lines express CD81, CD81 expression alone is not sufficient to allow viral entry. CD81 is required for HIV-HCV pseudotype infection since (i) a monoclonal antibody specific for CD81 inhibited infection of susceptible target cells and (ii) silencing of CD81 expression in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells by small interfering RNAs inhibited HIV-HCV pseudotype infection. Furthermore, expression of CD81 in human liver cells that were previously resistant to infection, HepG2 and HH29, conferred permissivity of HCV pseudotype infection. The characterization of chimeric CD9/CD81 molecules confirmed that the large extracellular loop of CD81 is a determinant for viral entry. These data suggest a functional role for CD81 as a coreceptor for HCV glycoprotein-dependent viral cell entry.\",\"Retrovirus tropism can be restricted by cellular factors such as Fv1, Ref1, and Lv1 that inhibit infection by targeting the incoming viral capsid. Here, we show that rodent cells exhibit differential sensitivity to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped lentiviruses and that differences between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) infectivity are sometimes, but not always, governed by determinants in capsid-p2. In at least one case, resistance to SIVmac infection could be eliminated by saturation of target cells with noninfectious SIVmac particles. However, cross-saturation experiments and analysis of Fv1-null cells engineered to express natural or artificial Fv1 proteins revealed that lentivirus restriction in mouse cells is independent of Fv1. Overall, these findings indicate that novel restriction factors in rodents can modulate sensitivity to specific primate lentiviruses.\",\"HIV-1 variants evolving in AIDS patients frequently show increased replicative capacity compared to those present during early asymptomatic infection. It is known that late stage HIV-1 variants often show an expanded coreceptor tropism and altered Nef function. In the present study we investigated whether enhanced HIV-1 LTR promoter activity might also evolve during disease progression. Our results demonstrate increased LTR promoter activity after AIDS progression in 3 of 12 HIV-1-infected individuals studied. Further analysis revealed that multiple alterations in the U3 core-enhancer and in the transactivation-response (TAR) region seem to be responsible for the enhanced functional activity. Our findings show that in a subset of HIV-1-infected individuals enhanced LTR transcription contributes to the increased replicative potential of late stage virus isolates and might accelerate disease progression.\",\"After the nearly complete and irreversible depletion of CD4(+) T lymphocytes induced by highly pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus chimeric viruses (SHIVs) during infections of rhesus monkeys, tissue macrophages are able to sustain high levels (>10(6) viral RNA copies/ml) of plasma viremia for several months. We recently reported that the virus present in the plasma during the late macrophage phase of infection had acquired changes that specifically targeted the V2 region of gp120 (H. Imamichi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:13813-13818, 2002); some of these SHIV variants were macrophage-tropic (M-tropic). Those findings have been extended by examining the tropic properties, coreceptor usage, and gp120 structure of five independent SHIVs recovered directly from lymph nodes of late-stage animals. All of these tissue-derived SHIV isolates were able to infect alveolar macrophages. These M-tropic SHIVs used CXCR4, not CCR5, for infections of rhesus monkey PBMC and primary alveolar macrophages. Because the starting highly pathogenic T-tropic SHIV inoculum also utilized CXCR4, these results indicate that the acquisition of M-tropism in the SHIV-macaque system is not accompanied by a change in coreceptor usage. Compared to the initial T-tropic SHIV inoculum, tissue-derived M-tropic SHIVs from individual infected animals carry gp120s containing similar changes (specific amino acid deletions, substitutions, and loss of N-linked glycosylation sites), primarily within the V1 and/or V2 regions of gp120.\",\"Murine leukemia virus (MLV) capsid particles can be efficiently pseudotyped with a variant of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) containing the surface glycoprotein gp120-SU and a carboxyl-terminally truncated transmembrane (TM) protein, with only seven cytoplasmic amino acids. MLV/HIV pseudotyped vector particles acquire the natural host tropism of HIV-1 and their entry is dependent on the presence of CD4 and an appropriate co-receptor on the surface of the target cell. We describe here the construction of chimeric MLV/HIV proviruses containing the truncated HIV envelope gene. The MLV/HIV provirus was generated by direct replacement of the MLV envelope gene with HIV Env coding sequences either with or without the additional inclusion of the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE). Chimeric MLV/HIV particles could be generated from transfected 293T cells and were able to infect CD4/CXCR4-positive target cells. However, the second round of infection of target cells was severely impaired, despite the fact that the WPRE element enhanced the amount of viral mRNA detected. Viral particles released from infected cells showed reduced HIV Env incorporation, indicating that additional factors required for efficient replication of MLV/HIV pseudotyped viruses are missing.\",\"Residues within the highly conserved C3 region of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV, SIV) envelope proteins (Envs) bind directly to the cellular CD4 receptor. However, substitutions of D385, which is critical for CD4 engagement along with other changes such as G382R, G383R, frequently arise in SIV mac-infected macaques. We investigated the influence of substitutions in the SIVmac and HIV-1 C3 regions on viral entry, dependence on CD4, and replication. Mutations flanking the C3 region such as G382R or V388A enhanced and changes within the C3 region (i.e., G383R or D385N) impaired SIVmac infectivity. Several naturally occurring sequence variations in the SIVmac Env C3 region facilitated CD4-independent membrane fusion but abrogated viral replication, suggesting that efficient infection requires additional changes elsewhere in Env. Substitutions of S365R and D368G in the HIV-1 Env, which correspond to G382 and D385 in SIVmac Env, consistently impaired viral infectivity. In contrast, mutation of D368N resulted in a virus that could not spread in cells expressing low levels of CD4, but which replicated efficiently when high levels of CD4 were expressed. Thus, changes in the C3 region of HIV-1 or SIVmac Env can have differential effects on viral infectivity and CD4-dependency. We conclude that substitutions flanking the C3 region in SIVmac Env such as G382R or V388A represent one step toward adaptation to growth in target cells expressing low CD4 levels, whereas changes within the C3 region that disrupt CD4 binding might indicate the emergence of CD4-independent variants at later stages of infection, which could potentially broaden viral tropism.\",\"The restriction of cell-free HIV-1 infection has been demonstrated in placental trophoblast choriocarcinoma BeWo cells. We tried to determine the level of the viral replication cycle at which this restriction occurs. BeWo cells produce infectious viruses after transfection with HIV-1 plasmids, independently of viral tropism. CCR5 and CXCR4, but not the CD4 molecule, were detected at the cell surface. We therefore derived CD4-expressing clones from transfected BeWo cells. Cell-free virus infection of these clones resulted in neither virus production nor viral sequence integration, indicating that the restriction occurs before integration of the virus. If we used luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with HIV-1 Env R5 and X4 for infection, no luciferase activity was detected, even in the BeWo-CD4+ clone, in contrast to what was observed in VSV-G pseudotyped virus infection. Our results show that infection of trophoblast-derived cells with cell-free virus is at least restricted at the level of entry. Thus, BeWo is an interesting human placental cell line that is resistant to HIV-1, even if CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 are expressed.\",\"Two well-established determinants of retroviral tropism are envelope sequences that regulate entry and LTR sequences that can regulate viral expression in a cell-specific manner. Studies with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) have demonstrated that tropism of this virus maps primarily to variable envelope sequences. Studies have demonstrated that T cell and macrophage-specific transcription factor binding motifs exist in the upstream region of the LTR U3; however, the ability of the core enhancer/promoter proximal elements (two NF-kappaB and three Sp1 sites) to function well in macrophages and T cells have led many to conclude that HIV LTR sequences are not primary determinants of HIV tropism. To determine if cellular specificity could be imparted to HIV by the core enhancer elements, the enhancer/promoter proximal region of the HIV LTR was substituted with motifs that control gene expression in a myeloid-specific manner. The enhancer region from equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) when substituted for the HIV enhancer/promoter proximal region was found to drive expression in a macrophage-specific manner and was responsive to HIV Tat. The addition of a 5' methylation-dependent binding site (MDBP) and a promoter proximal Sp1 motif increased expression without altering cellular specificity. Spacing between the promoter proximal region and the TATA box was also found to influence LTR activity. Infectivity studies using chimeric LTRs within the context of a dual-tropic infectious molecular clone established that these LTRs directed HIV replication and production of infectious virions in macrophages but not primary T cells or T cell lines. This investigation demonstrates that cellular specificity can be imparted onto HIV-1 replication at the level of viral transcription and not entry.\",\"The notable glomerular feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the collapse of the capillary tuft with marked glomerular epithelial cell hyperplasia. These data suggest a loss of normal podocyte function, which is associated with a loss of the podocyte differentiation markers, Wilm's tumor (WT-1), synaptopodin, podocalyxin, and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). We have previously shown that HIV-1 expression can induce these changes in HIV-1 transgenic mice. To identify which HIV-1 gene product(s) are responsible for the phenotypic changes in podocytes, we created multiple mutated HIV-1 constructs and then pseudotyped them with vesticular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) envelope to enhance the tropism of these mutant viruses. In addition to gag/pol, the mutant viruses lacked one of the following, env, nef, rev, vif, vpr, or vpu. In addition, we generated single gene expressing pseudotyped viruses to complement the scanning mutation approach of our viral parental construct. Murine podocytes were then infected with one of the viral constructs either lacking or expressing the various HIV-1 genes. We found that HIV-1 nef was necessary and sufficient for proliferation of podocytes and down-regulation of synaptopodin and CALLA. These data suggest that Nef induces many of the changes we observe in HIV transgenic model and, as a result, this now defines the pathway for exploration of host responses to HIV-1 infection.\",\"HIV-1 comprises a collection of closely related, but not identical, viruses or quasispecies. Fitness represents a selective advantage for propagation among populations of organisms competing in a particular environment and is an important characteristic of viruses because of a link between fitness and pathogenesis. Environmental differences based on the type of cell that is targeted for infection or the cell type that produces virus, impact fitness. CD4-expressing cells of lymphocyte or macrophage lineage are the principal host cells for HIV-1, although the milieu in lymphocytes is distinct from the macrophage environment from the perspective of cell half-life and activation, signal transduction and expression of coreceptors, and bioavailability of antiretroviral drugs. Multiple viral determinants, including entry via envelope glycoproteins, replication by reverse transcriptase, and virion maturation by protease activity, contribute to fitness in different cells and provide targets for current antiretroviral therapies. This review focuses on fitness of HIV-1 in macrophages and examines the impact of protease inhibitors on fitness of quasispecies and an unexplained discordance between fitness and pathogenesis.\",\"Heterologous lentiviral vectors (LVs) represent a way to address safety concerns in the field of gene therapy by decreasing the possibility of genetic recombination between vector and packaging constructs and the generation of replication-competent viruses. Using described LVs based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus MAC251 (SIV(MAC251)), we asked whether heterologous virion particles in which trans-acting factors belonged to HIV-1 and cis elements belonged to SIV(MAC251) (HIV-siv) would behave as parental homologous vectors in all cell types. To our surprise, we found that although the heterologous HIV-siv vector was as infectious as its homologous counterpart in most human cells, it was defective in the transduction of dendritic cells (DCs) and, to a lesser extent, macrophages. In DCs, the main postentry defect was observed in the formation of two-long-terminal-repeat circles, despite the fact that full-length proviral DNA was being synthesized and was associated with the nucleus. Taken together, our data suggest that heterologous HIV-siv vectors display a cell-dependent infectivity defect, most probably at a post-nuclear entry migration step. As homologous HIV and SIV vectors do transduce DCs, we believe that these results underscore the importance of a conserved interaction between cis elements and trans-acting viral factors that is lost or suboptimal in heterologous vectors and essential only in the transduction of certain cell types. For gene therapy purposes, these findings indicate that the cellular tropism of LVs can be modulated not only through the use of distinct envelope proteins or tissue-specific promoters but also through the specific combinatorial use of packaging and transfer vector constructs.\",\"In a previous study using an early-generation VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the transcriptional control of a human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter, we examined transduction efficiency in dissociated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. In cultures of murine origin, transgene expression was observed solely in the sensory neurons with the stromal cell population failing to show evidence of transduction. In contrast, efficient and sustained transduction of both sensory neurons and the stromal cell population was observed in cultures of human origin. Given the widespread use of murine models in preclinical gene therapy studies, in the current study we investigated the basis of this apparent neuron specificity of lentivirus-mediated transduction in murine DRG cultures. The interspecies differences persisted at high multiplicities of infection, and irrespective of whether lentiviral vector stocks were packaged in the presence or absence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) accessory proteins. Cell-type specificity of CMV promoter expression, tropism of the VSV-G envelope, and blocks to molecular transduction were also precluded as possible mechanisms, thereby implicating transcriptional repression of the internal heterologous promoter. This promoter interference effect was found to be mediated by cis-acting sequences upstream of the core promoter elements located in the U3 region of the proviral long terminal repeats (LTRs). Deletion of this region, as in late-generation self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus vectors, relieves this effect. This provides a basis for reevaluating data produced using early-generation U3-bearing lentivirus vectors and for reconciling these with results obtained using more contemporary SIN lentivirus vectors carrying a U3 deletion.\",\"To study the progression of HIV-1 infection and coreceptor usages in Central African Republic, clinical data, plasma viral load, and coreceptor usage of sequential HIV-1 isolates were analyzed in a seroincident prospective cohort (PRIMOCA). Twenty-three HIV-1 infected individuals from the Central African Armed Forces were followed from 1995 to 2000. Viruses were isolated from 17 patients at various time points after seroconversion and their coreceptor usage was examined using GHOST cells expressing CD4 and one of the HIV-1 chemokine coreceptors CCR5, CXCR4, BOB/GPR15, and Bonzo/STRL33/CXCR6. Eleven patients died from AIDS. Eight of them died between 2 and 5 years after seroconversion, after a brief symptomatic stage. Patients who rapidly progressed to AIDS and death displayed the highest viral loads after seroconversion. All isolates obtained soon after seroconversion used CCR5, albeit, in some cases, CXCR4, BOB, or Bonzo were also used. Most isolates remained R5 (59 out of 61 isolates), although viruses using CXCR4 appeared in some cases of progression to AIDS. In several cases, a broad tropism was observed during the course of infection, with a frequent usage of BOB and Bonzo in addition to CCR5. Rapid progression to disease and short survival time among Central African HIV-1 patients appear more frequent than those reported in industrialized countries. Viral coreceptor used was mainly CCR5, but, interestingly, a large part of isolates also used BOB and Bonzo. However, there was no strict correlation between the clinical outcome and extended viral tropism.\",\"Resting CD4(+) T cells in the lymphoid tissue (LT) are essential producers of virions at the beginning of HIV infection in vivo. We previously developed a model that allowed in vitro infection of non-prestimulated T lymphocytes in the presence of autologous B lymphocytes and complement. In this study, we try to clarify the mechanism(s) responsible for virus transmission in unstimulated autologous B cell/T cell co-cultures. Ex vivo analyses of patient plasma samples revealed that HIV was opsonized. Flow cytometry showed that opsonized virus preferentially bound to complement receptor (CR)-2 on B lymphocytes in primary B cell/T cell co-cultures. As indicated by cytokine measurements and transwell experiments, soluble factors seemed to play a minor role in enabling infection. Rather, direct interaction between B and T lymphocytes and direct binding of opsonized virus to CR2 on B cells turned out to be essential for productive infection. Antibodies blocking cell-cell adhesion inhibited p24 antigen production. An anti-CR2 antibody blocking C3d-CR2 binding also significantly reduced viral replication. Since the infection of unstimulated T cells by opsonized primary HIV isolates in the presence of B cells was highly efficient independent of the tropism of the virus, this mechanism may be critical in the pathogenesis of HIV.\",\"Little is known about the impact of HIV-1 group M subtypes on mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 in African settings where multiple HIV-1 group M subtypes are co-circulating. To assess the role of subtype variation on MTCT. HIV-1-infected women attending an antenatal clinic in western Kenya were enrolled for a prospective study (1996-2000) of MTCT. HIV-1 subtype analysis of p24gag and gp41env identified potential recombinants, and their role in MTCT was determined. Among 414 women for whom HIV-1 subtype and HIV transmission status were available, MTCT occurred in 80 (19.3%). MTCT rates were higher among women with subtype D compared with subtype A in either the gp41 region [31.6 versus 16.1%, relative risk (RR) 2.0, P=0.002] or p24 region (29.9 versus 18.0%, RR 1.7, P=0.02). Discordant subtype combinations were identified in 103 of the women (25.9%), and were associated with higher rates of MTCT (28.2 versus 17.0%, RR 1.7, P=0.01). In multivariate analysis, women with subtype combinations D/D, D/A, and A/D had an increased risk of MTCT (adjusted odds ratios 3.5, 2.5, 6.2; P=0.005, 0.05, and 0.0003, respectively) compared with A/A women after adjustment for maternal HIV viral load, placental malaria infection, episiotomy or perineal tear, and low birthweight. MTCT appears to be more common among mothers infected with subtype D compared with subtype A. Such differences in MTCT frequency may be caused by altered cellular tropism for placental cell types.\",\"Although HIV type 1 (HIV-1) cannot efficiently replicate in simian cells, the mechanism(s) involved in the restriction of virus tropism remain unclear. To investigate this, we have focused on the identification of human cellular factors that can influence the infectivity of HIV-1 derived from African green monkey producer cells. Whereas the infectivity of HIV-1 derived from such cells was only 10-15% of that of human cell-derived virus, expression of human topoisomerase I in the African green monkey cells resulted in a 5-fold increase of the infectivity of progeny HIV-1 virions. Replacement of glutamate-236 and asparagine-237 of human topoisomerase I with the corresponding residues (aspartate and serine, respectively) of the African green monkey enzyme abolished this enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity. This positive effect of human topoisomerase I expression in the African green monkey producer cells seemed to result from the promotion of HIV-1 cDNA synthesis. Thus, human topoisomerase I plays an important role in HIV-1 replication and infectivity, and differences in the species specificity of HIV-1 infection can at least in part be attributed to differences in topoisomerase I activities.\",\"HIV-2 can use a broader range of co-receptors than HIV-1 in vitro, and is less dependent on CD4 for infection. The aim of this study was to detect productive HIV-2 infection in the brain and investigate whether HIV-2 has an expanded tropism for brain cells in vivo, in comparison with HIV-1, which productively infects macrophages/microglia. Brain samples taken at autopsy from eight patients who died from AIDS, six HIV-2 and two HIV-1/HIV-2 dually seropositive, with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), collected in Abidjan, C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire in 1991, were examined for the presence and localization of productive HIV-2 infection. Using immunohistochemistry, the presence of HIV-2 p26 in formalin-fixed, wax-embedded brain tissue sections was investigated. Double-staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD45- and CD68-specific antibodies was performed to identify infected cell types. HIV-2 p26 was detected in brain tissue from four of the HIV-2 cases and one of the dually infected individuals. The productively infected cells were either microglia or infiltrating macrophages. The productively infected cells in the brains of HIV-2 infected individuals are macrophages/microglia. No evidence was found for productive infection of astrocytes, neurons or oligodendrocytes. Thus, the broader in vitro cell tropism, promiscuous coreceptor usage and relative independence of CD4 by HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 does not broaden its range of target cells in the brain.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C viruses have been found to almost exclusively use the chemokine receptor CCR5 as a coreceptor for entry, even in patients with advanced AIDS. We have characterized subtype C virus isolates from 28 patients from Harare, Zimbabwe, 20 of whom were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Virus from 10 of the treated patients induced syncytium formation (SI virus) when cultured with MT2 cells. Only non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) virus was cultured from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the eight patients who had not received treatment. The majority of these subtype C SI viruses were capable of using both CCR5 and CXCR4 as coreceptors for viral entry, and the consensus V3 loop sequences from the SI viruses displayed a high net charge compared to those of NSI viruses. While those on treatment had reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease mutations, there was no clear association between RT and protease drug resistance mutations and coreceptor tropism. These results suggest that CXCR4-tropic viruses are present within the quasispecies of patients infected with subtype C virus and that antiretroviral treatment may create an environment for the emergence of CXCR4 tropism.\",\"In this study we examined secretory IgA, isolated from the parotid saliva of 10 HIV-1-infected subjects, for its ability to influence HIV-1 infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with two R5 and two X4 primary isolates. Salivary IgA from four subjects was found to inhibit both R5 viruses but not the X4 viruses. In another subject, salivary IgA inhibited both X4 viruses but not the R5 viruses. The specificity of these antibodies seemed to be directed against, but not restricted to, gp160 and gp120. Compared with subjects whose salivary IgA did not inhibit HIV-1 infection, subjects who displayed neutralizing activity were in relatively early stages of disease and had CD4(+) T cell counts greater than 200 cells/microl. Our data indicate the presence of tropism-specific (more frequently R5-specific) neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected subjects. Because mucosal transmission of HIV-1 occurs exclusively in R5 viruses, and X4 viruses often emerge in established infection and account for viral persistence later in disease, our data suggest a potential role for secretory IgA in preventing viral transmission, but a less likely effect on chronic infection.\",\"Sindbis virus (SIN) expression vectors offer the opportunity for studying neuropathogenesis because of their distinct neural cell tropism. Here, we demonstrate that a recombinant SIN vector expressing EGFP (SINrep5-EGFP) infected multiple cell types including neural cells from several species relevant to lentivirus pathogenesis with high levels of transgene expression. Infection of human neurons by a recombinant SIN (SINrep5-JRFL) expressing the full-length envelope from a neurovirulent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain (JRFL) caused increased cytotoxicity compared to infection with SINrep5-EGFP (P < 0.001), while no cytotoxicity was observed among infected human astrocytes or monocytoid cells. Both human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) (P < 0.01) and astrocytes (P < 0.001) infected with SINrep5-JRFL released soluble neurotoxins in contrast to SINrep5-EGFP or mock-infected cells, although this was most prominent for the astrocytes. Implantation of SINrep5-JRFL into the brains of SCID/NOD mice induced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurobehavioral changes characteristic of HIV-1 infection, which were not present in SINrep5-EGFP or mock-infected animals. Thus SIN expression vectors represent novel tools for studying in vitro and in vivo HIV-1 neuropathogenesis because of their high levels of transgene expression in specific cell types within the brain.\",\"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) is an oncogenic retrovirus that exhibits specific tropism for human T-cells. The capsid (CA) proteins of retroviruses share highly conserved secondary and tertiary structures. However, they can form quaternary structures (assembled cores) that are conical (e.g., the lentivirus subgroup, including HIV) or spherical (e.g., the oncovirus subgroup, including HTLV). The intrinsic features that drive these differences are not understood. So far, only structural studies have been used as a basis for comparison. Dynamics may play a role in particle formation. High-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (15)N relaxation data (T(1), T(1rho), and NOE) have been used to characterize the backbone dynamics of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the oncovirus HTLV-I and to compare with the CA NTD of HIV-1. Large variations in the (15)N heteronuclear NOEs and transversal relaxation rates for individual residues are consistent with the bundle RMSD of the previously calculated NMR structures. The beta-hairpin and CyP-A loop exhibit different mobility in HTLV-I and HIV-1. The overall hydrodynamic property of the HTLV-I capsid NTD is quite distinct from the HIV-1.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 V3 loop plays a predominant role in chemokine receptor usage; however, other linear and nonlinear gp120 domains are involved in this step of the HIV-1 replication cycle. At present, the functional relationship between V3 and these domains with regard to coreceptor usage is unclear. To gain insights into the nature of this relationship in naturally selected viral variants, we developed a recombinant strategy based on two different gp120 backbones derived from CXCR4 (X4)- and CCR5 (R5)-tropic viral strains, respectively. Using this recombinant model system, we evaluated the phenotype patterns conferred to chimeric viruses by exogenous V3 loops from reference molecular clones and samples from infected subjects. In 13 of 17 recombinants (76%), a comparable phenotype was observed independently of the gp120 backbone, whereas in a minority of the recombinant viruses (4/17, 24%) viral infectivity depended on the gp120 context. No case of differential tropism using identical V3 sequence in the two gp120 contexts was observed. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed to evaluate the phenotypic impact of specific V3 motifs. The data indicate that while the interaction of HIV-1 with chemokine receptors is driven by V3 loop and influenced by its evolutionary potential, the gp120 context plays a role in influencing the replication competence of the variants, suggesting that compensatory mutations occurring at sites other than V3 are necessary in some cases.\",\"Unlike oncoretroviruses, lentiviral vectors can insert large genes and can target both dividing and nondividing cells; thus they hold unique promise as gene transfer agents. To enhance target range, the native lentiviral envelope glycoprotein is replaced (pseudotyped) with vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG), and the genes of interest are packaged in nonreplicating vectors by transient transfection with three plasmids. However, because of cytotoxic effects of VSVG expression in producer cells (293T cells) it has been difficult to generate a packaging cell line, required for even modest scale-up of vector production. Here we introduce a pseudotyped lentivirus vector using the baculovirus GP64 envelope glycoprotein. Compared with VSVG, GP64 vectors exhibited a similar broad tropism and similar native titers. GP64-pseudotyped vectors were usually highly concentrated without much loss of titer. Because, unlike VSVG, GP64 expression does not kill cells, we generated 293T-based cell lines constitutively expressing GP64. Our results demonstrate that the baculovirus GP64 protein is an attractive alternative to VSVG for viral vectors used in the large-scale production of high-titer virus required for clinical and commercial applications.\",\"To reveal the mechanism of transient infection of T cell by HIV-1 isolates of early stages from Yunnan and Xinjiang, China. We made these viruses pass on CXCR4 expressing T cell lines and CCR5 expressing U937 cell line. After having observed the biological phenotype, we analyzed sequences of env gene to find genetic mutations of the strains, and used heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) to show the complexity of the virus groups. Sequence analysis indicated that these viruses are M tropic, NSI strains, correlating with their phenotype; they mutated largely through T cell passage, all showed sequence characteristics deviating from M tropic/NSI to different extents. HMA results indicated the complexity of virus groups was low at the very beginning of the passage and kept high later. We concluded that these viruses tried mutating to different directions to adapt the T cell line but all failed. Although env gene correlates with cell tropism, coreceptor usage and HIV syncytium inducing, it may have relationship with the whole genome, whether these phenotypes are present or not. The results imply that there is no T tropic/SI strain in the M topic/NSI virus pool in early infection, it is generated later following continued infection in vivo.\",\"Infection of epithelial colon carcinoma cell line HT29 with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) NDK, a subtype D virus highly cytopathic for CD4-positive lymphocytes, results in the selection of HIV-1 variants, 1000 times more infectious for CD4(-) intestinal cells than the parental virus. Here, we demonstrate that the envelope gene of intestinal cell-adapted virus conferred to recombinant clone HIV-1 iNDK the ability to utilize CXCR4 without CD4 while retaining its tropism for CD4 lymphocytes. Among the major genetic changes required for infection of intestinal cells and CD4 independence, two potential N-glycosylation sites appeared as a result of the extension of five amino acids in the V1/V2 region and three amino acid changes ((296)KYT --> (296)NNI) were identified in the V3 loop of HIV-1 iNDK gp120. Our studies suggest that CD4-independent use of CXCR4 can be mediated by different adaptive changes related to the microenvironment of CD4(-) cell.\",\"We have studied infectivity and neutralization of X4, R5, and R5X4 tropic HIV-1 mutants, which are lacking N-linked glycosylation sites for glycans g13, g14, g15, and g17 in the V3 loop region of gp120. X4-tropic NL4-3 mutants lacking combinations of g14/15 or g15/17 showed markedly higher infectivity in CXCR4-specific infection. The role of g15 in CCR5-specific infection was investigated using viruses with high (NL-918, R5-monotropic), medium (NL-991, R5-monotropic), and low (NL-952, R5X4-dualtropic) CCR5-specific infectivity. For NL-991, a reduction of infectivity on GHOST-CCR5 cells was observed for a mutant lacking g15. For NL-952 mutants all lacking g15, a complete loss of CCR5-specificity was observed and NL-952 was shifted from R5X4 to X4 tropism. For all mutants of NL4-3, NL-991, and NL-952, where the lack of g15 markedly influenced infectivity or coreceptor usage, neutralization was enhanced. In contrast, NL-918 mutants with or without g15 showed no difference in neutralization and no difference in GHOST-CCR5 infection rates. Thus, for viruses with a low or medium CCR5-specificity the role of g15 for changing CCR5-usage and sensitivity to neutralization was more significant than for viruses with high infection rates on GHOST-CCR5 cells. Our data demonstrate that V3 glycans play an important role in the usage of CXCR4 and CCR5. The lack of g15 was relevant for a more efficient use of CXCR4, whereas interaction with CCR5 was facilitated in the presence of g15. This study also demonstrates that glycan g15 is involved in blocking of neutralizing antibodies and shifting HIV tropism from R5X4 to X4.\",\"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) requires binding of the viral envelope gp120 to CD4 and to the CXCR4 coreceptor. Both, gp120 and CXCR4 are subject to N-glycosylation. Here we investigated the influence of the N-linked glycans g1 and g2 present on CXCR4 for HIV-1 infection. The two CXCR4 N-glycosylation sites g1 (NYT) and g2 (NVS) were mutated by changing the first or third amino acids N or T/S to Q and A respectively (g1; N11Q or T13A; g2, N176Q or S178A). Human osteosarcoma cells (GHOST) expressing human CD4 and the various CXCR4 glycosylation mutants were tested for infection using NL4-3-based viruses with X4, R5 or R5X4-tropism differing only in the V3 loop region. All constructed cell lines expressing the various CXCR4 glycomutants showed similar permissiveness for the X4-monotropic virus and no change in the coreceptor specificity that allows infection of a CCR5-dependent R5-monotropic virus. Interestingly, the removal of glycan g1 significantly enhanced the permissiveness of GHOST cells for the R5X4 dualtropic virus. GHOST cells expressing the CXCR4-g1 or CXCR4-g1/2 mutants were infected at higher rates by the R5X4-dualtropic virus compared to cells expressing CXCR4-wt or CXCR4-g2 coreceptors. Our present observations underscore a role for glycans present on the CXCR4 coreceptor in the entry process of HIV-1. The data will help to better understand the multifaceted mechanism of HIV infection and the selective forces which drive HIV-1 evolution from mono- to dual-tropism.\",\"Specific mutations in VPR and V2 potentially restrict HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Such restriction could potentially limit HIV replication in long-term non-progressors (LTNP), thus accounting for low viral load and delayed progression to AIDS. To examine whether a specific VPR phenotype (truncated versus non-truncated) correlates with disease progression and whether elongated V2 restricts viral replication in macrophages or alters viral tropism. Sequence analysis was carried for VPR and V1-V3 env from four rapid progressors (RPs), six late progressors (LPs), and three LTNPs in cohort of HIV-1-infected homosexual men. The replication kinetics of sequential isolates was examined in primary CD4 cells and macrophages and coreceptor usage was determined by GHOST infection assays. No differences were found in the VPR protein from RP and LTNP isolates. Analysis of the V2 region revealed that all RPs maintained similar V2 lengths (40 aa), whereas LPs and LTNPs acquired additional amino acids (2-13 aa) in the V2 region. Coreceptor specificity revealed that RP switch from CCR5 to multiple coreceptor usage, whereas LTNPs maintained R5 viruses. Sequential isolates from each group revealed comparable replication efficiencies in both T-cells and macrophages, regardless of the V2 length or coreceptor utilization. In addition, cross-section analysis of six LTNPs from Australia revealed extended V2 with consistent usage of CCR5 coreceptor. The present results suggest that acquisition of a V2 extension over time in HIV-1-infected LPs/LTNPs appears to correlate with maintenance of CCR5 usage among LTNPs. These findings may be important for a better understanding of the host interactions and disease progression.\",\"Characterization of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 enters cells has allowed for an increased understanding of not only tropism and pathogenesis, but also the identification of new targets for rational drug design. Several classes of HIV-1 entry inhibitors have been developed. Antagonists targeting the interaction of the viral envelope protein and receptors on the cell surface, as well as peptides that target an intermediate in the fusion process, have shown promise in vitro and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The addition of entry inhibitors to current drug regimens has the potential to significantly improve the therapeutic options for infected individuals, which is crucial for those resistant to or failing currently available therapies.\",\"Herpesvirus saimiri-immortalized CD4(+) T lymphocytes (HVS T cells) are activated memory cells that support efficient replication of primary R5 strains of HIV-1, which predominate in virus transmission. Being continuous, they are phenotypically more stable and technically less demanding than peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here we present the first report using HVS T cells to assay HIV-1 neutralization in vitro. Neutralization sensitivities of paired viruses isolated from individuals in both HVS T cells (CN-2 cells) and PBMCs were similar, with homologous and heterologous plasma/sera in both CN-2- and PBMC-based assays. Analysis of V3 loop and CD4-binding site (CD4-BS) sequences showed that changes present in CN-2 isolates were neither more numerous nor more significant than those selected in their PBMC counterparts. Neutralization profiles of CN-2/PBMC virus pairs were similar again when V3- and CD4-binding site (BS)-specific monoclonal antibodies, whose mapped epitopes were conserved or of similar sequence in the virus pairs, were tested. Unlike other T cell line isolates, CN-2 isolates were not more sensitive to neutralization than their PBMC counterparts. We also show that HVS T cells do not appear to exert significant biological selection pressures on primary isolates. Paired viruses have a similar phenotype with respect to syncytium formation, cell tropism, and coreceptor usage. Thus CN-2 cells are suitable hosts for assaying neutralization and could be useful in standardizing neutralization assays performed in different laboratories.\",\"Macrophages express both CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors, but restrict X4 HIV-1 replication unless the Env-V3 region, a major determinant of cell tropism, is exchanged with that of R5 HIV-1. As the V3 exchange concomitantly alters the nucleotide sequences, we introduced silent mutations in the V3 or C2 region of macrophage-tropic R5 JRFL without changing the amino acids. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that viral proteins including Env-gp120 were similarly incorporated in wild-type (wt) and mutant virions. The silent mutants infected CCR5-positive MAGIC5 cells but not CCR5-negative MAGI cells, as productively as wt viruses, indicating that the silent mutations did not alter coreceptor utilization. In contrast, two of three silent V3-mutant viruses failed to replicate efficiently in primary macrophages, whereas other V3- or C2-mutants and wt JRFL infected macrophages productively. Furthermore, synthesis of the full-length viral DNA of the aberrant V3-mutant was largely reduced in macrophages. These results suggest that V3 nucleotide sequences may be one of the postentry factors restricting HIV-1 replication in macrophages.\",\"Many nonhuman primate cells are unable to support the replication of HIV-1, whereas others are nonpermissive for infection by simian immunodeficiency virus from macaques (SIVmac). Here, we show that restricted HIV-1 and SIVmac infection of primate cell lines shares some salient features with Fv1 and Ref1-mediated restriction of murine retrovirus infection. In particular, the nonpermissive phenotype is most evident at low multiplicities of infection, results in reduced accumulation of reverse transcription products, and is dominant in heterokaryons generated by fusion of permissive and nonpermissive target cells. Moreover, in nonpermissive primate cells, HIV-1 and SIVmac infection is cooperative, and enveloped HIV-1 virus-like particles, minimally containing Gag and protease, abrogate restriction. In African green monkey cells, HIV-1 virus-like particles ablate restrictions to HIV-1 and SIVmac, suggesting that both are restricted by the same factor. Finally, a virus that contains an HIV-1 capsid-p2 domain in an SIVmac background exhibits a tropism for primate cells that is HIV-1-like rather than SIVmac-like. These data indicate the existence of one or more saturable inhibitors that are polymorphic in primates and prevent HIV and SIV infection by targeting the capsid of the incoming lentivirus particle.\",\"We investigated the infectivities and replicative capacities of a large panel of variants of the molecular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) NL4-3 clone that differ exclusively in the V3 region of the viral envelope glycoprotein and the nef gene. Our results demonstrate that Nef enhances virion infectivity and HIV-1 replication independently of the viral coreceptor tropism.\",\"To analyze HIV-1 genes in a nonhuman primate model for lentivirus infection and AIDS, recombinant SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV) clones were constructed from two HIV-1 subtype-A isolates (HIV-1(SF170) and HIV-1(Q23-17) from individuals in Africa) and two HIV-1 subtype-E isolates (HIV-1(9466) and HIV-1(CAR402) from AIDS patients in Thailand and Africa), respectively. These four SHIV clones, designated SHIV-A-170, SHIV-A-Q23, SHIV-9466.33, and SHIV-E-CAR, contain envelope (env) genes from the subtype-A or -E viruses. Interestingly, SHIV-A-170, SHIV-A-Q23, and SHIV-9466.33 were restricted for replication in cultures of macaque lymphoid cells, whereas SHIV-E-CAR replicated efficiently in these cells. Additional studies to define the block to replication in macaque cells were focused on the subtype-E clone SHIV-9466.33. A SHIV intragenic env clone, containing sequence-encompassing V1/V2 regions of HIV-1(CAR402) and V3/V4/V5 regions of SHIV-9466.33, infected and replicated in macaque lymphoid cells. These results indicated that the sequence-encompassing V1/V2 region of HIV-1(9466) was responsible for the block of the SHIV-9466.33 replication in macaque cells. Analysis of viral DNA in acutely infected macaque cells revealed that SHIV-9466.33 was blocked at a step at/or before viral DNA synthesis, presumably during the process of virion entry into cells. In a fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assay, fusion pore formation readily took place in cocultures of cells expressing the SHIV-9466.33 env glycoprotein with macaque T-lymphoid cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the block of SHIV-9466.33 replication in macaque cells is at an early step after fusion pore formation but before reverse transcription.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exploits cell surface receptors to attach to and gain entry into cells. The HIV envelope spike glycoprotein on the surface of virus particles binds both CD4 and a seven-transmembrane coreceptor. These interactions trigger conformational changes in the envelope spike that induce fusion of viral and cellular membranes and entry of the viral core into the cell cytoplasm. Other cell surface receptors also interact with gp120 and aid attachment of virus particles. This review describes these receptors, their roles in HIV entry and their influence on cell tropism.\",\"Viruses use specific cell surface receptors to bind to and subsequently gain entry into their host cells. Some retroviruses such as HIV-1 and HIV-2 utilize one receptor for high-affinity binding (CD4), and a separate coreceptor to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (CCR5 or CXCR4). The identification of these receptors explains the cellular tropism of HIV, and hence its pathogenesis leading to immune deficiency (T-helper cell depletion), the wasting syndrome (macrophage infection), and dementia (microglia infection). HIV can infect cells by membrane fusion at the cell surface and by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Knowledge of the HIV receptors has led to practical developments such as inhibitory drugs, reasons for genetic resistance to infection, and should inform the judicious choice of candidate vaccines.\",\"Secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) is an endogenous mucosa associated protein that has been proposed to possess anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological function of SLPI in salivary mediated inhibition of HIV infection and in addition the inhibitory effect of SLPI using isolates of varied virus tropism. The inhibitory effect of HIV-1 infection in vitro, mediated by 60 different saliva samples was analyzed with respect to levels of SLPI. Salivary samples depleted from IgA and SLPI, respectively, were further analyzed for anti-HIV activity. The antiviral effect of recombinant SLPI was investigated within an in vitro system of HIV-1 infection of target cells using a panel of viral isolates with distinct coreceptor usage. Furthermore we tested a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides, representing the amino acids in SLPI, for their capacity to inhibit HIV-1 infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These experiments show that elevated levels of salivary SLPI can be associated with an increased inhibitory effect of the whole saliva sample, and that this inhibitory effect is decreased with broad coreceptor usage of the virus.\",\"Early infection with HIV-1 is dominated by CCR5-tropic (R5, non-syncytium-inducing) viruses. The evolution of CXCR4-tropic (X4, syncytium-inducing) viruses occurs later in the infection and is associated with rapid disease progression. Here, we propose that the tropism of X4 viruses for naive CD4+ T cells is disadvantageous in early infection owing to the low division rate of these cells. In healthy individuals, the division rate of memory cells is nearly ten times higher than that of naive cells and thus the memory-cell tropism of R5 viruses could account for their dominance early in infection. As the division rate of naive T cells increases with CD4+ depletion, X4 viruses come to dominate in late disease.\",\"The Sydney Blood Bank Cohort is a group of patients with slowly progressive infection by a human immunodeficiency virus strain containing spontaneous deletions within the nef long terminal repeat region. In 1999, 18 years after the initial infection, one of the members (D36) developed AIDS. In this work, we used an ex vivo human lymphoid cell culture system to analyze two viral isolates obtained from this patient, one prior to the onset of AIDS in 1995 and one after disease progression in 1999. Both D36 isolates were less potent in depleting CD4(+) T cells than a reference dualtropic, nef-bearing viral isolate. However, the 1999 isolate was measurably more cytotoxic to CD4(+) T cells than the 1995 isolate. Interestingly, although both isolates were nearly equally potent in depleting CCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells, the cytotoxic effect of the 1999 isolate toward CCR5(-) CD4(+) T cells was significantly higher. Furthermore, GHOST cell infection assays and blocking experiments with the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 showed that the later D36 1999 isolate could infect both CCR5(+) and CCR5(-) CXCR4(+) cells efficiently, while infection by the 1995 isolate was nearly completely restricted to CCR5(+) cells. Sequence analysis of the V1/V2 and V3 regions of the viral envelope protein gp120 revealed that the more efficient CXCR4 usage of the later isolate might be caused by an additional potential N-glycosylation site in the V1/V2 loop. In conclusion, these data show that an in vivo evolution of the tropism of this nef-deleted strain toward an X4 phenotype was associated with a higher cytopathic potential and progression to AIDS.\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"An infectious molecular clone (named p95TNIH022) was constructed using long-range polymerase chain reaction products derived from a clinical isolate (95TNIH022) of HIV-1 CRF01_AE obtained from an asymptomatic Thai carrier in 1995. The virus in the supernatant from p95TNIH022-transfected 293T cells showed infectivity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as in MAGIC5 cells, which express CD4 and CCR5, but not in the original MAGI cells, indicating that p95TNIH022 is an infectious molecular clone with CCR5 tropism. Interestingly, p95TNIH022-derived virus induced profound cell killing in infected PBMCs, as in cells infected with the parental isolate.\",\"Clinical and experimental studies of HIV-1 subcomponents were made in order to increase their immunogenicity. HIV subtype envelopes A, B and C have been compared and a detailed analysis made by peptides of the coreceptor-ligand interactions. We identified a direct interaction between HIV-1 envelope and a cellular receptor at the amino acid level. Both the viral subtype and its tropism appeared to influence inhibition of infection. Genetic immunization induced new cytotoxic responses while proteins appeared to efficiently boost previous responses. One HIV-1 subtype B antigen was strongly immunogenic in a human immunotherapeutic trial and permitted better survival at 2 years of the study in patients with poor prognosis.\",\"Sequence analysis of the third hypervariable region (V3) of the envelope gene of the HIV-1 was carried out on HIV proviral and viral populations present in blood and semen. Phylogenetically distinct populations of virus were observed in three of the 10 patients analysed. Although the majority of the viruses were predicted to have an R5 phenotype, amino acid differences between blood and semen-derived virus and provirus sequences were observed at sites previously shown to affect cell tropism. Importantly, the semen proviral population was representative of that observed for cell-free virus. This indicates that seminal fluid mononuclear cells are possible sources for the cell-free virus in found in semen.\",\"The mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of a man (VH) homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 mutation were investigated, and coreceptors other than CCR5 used by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from this individual were identified. In contrast to previous reports, this individual's rate of disease progression was not accelerated. Homozygosity for CCR5Delta32 mutation was demonstrated by PCR and DNA sequencing (R. Biti et al., Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997). CCR5 surface expression was absent on T lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV was isolated by coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from siblings who were homozygous (VM) or wild type (WT) for the CCR5Delta32 mutation. The virus demonstrated dual tropism for infection of MT2 cell line and primary macrophages. Sequencing of the full HIV genome directly from the patient's PBMCs revealed 21 nucleotide insertions in the V1 region of gp120. The VH envelope sequence segregated apart from both the T-cell-line-adapted tropic strains NL4-3 and SF2 and M-tropic strain JRFL or YU2 by phylogenetic tree analysis. VH was shown to utilize predominantly CXCR4 for entry into T lymphocytes and macrophages by HOS.CD4 cell infection assay, direct envelope protein fusion, and inhibition by anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (12G5), SDF-1, and AMD3100. Microsatellite mapping demonstrated the separate inheritance of CXCR4 by both homozygote brothers (VH and VM). Our study demonstrates the ability of certain strains of HIV to readily use CXCR4 for infection or entry into macrophages, which is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of late-stage disease and presumably also HIV transmission.\",\"Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) are two of the major opportunistic agents involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS, which is caused by human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2). A body of evidence suggests that they can also act as co-factors by interacting with HIV-1, thereby influencing disease progression. Indeed, the HIV-1 life cycle can be affected by HSV at different levels of interaction, both in vitro and in vivo: (i) transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat can be mediated, probably through different pathways, by HSV-1-infected cell protein (ICP)0, ICP4, ICP27 and US11 gene products; the HSV-1 transactivator viral protein 16 is not able to transactivate the long terminal repeat; (ii) cytokine release and antigen presentation from HSV-infected cells are both able to stimulate HIV-1 expression; (iii) Pseudotyping of the HIV-1 core particle with HSV-1 envelope glycoproteins can expand HIV-1 tropism to new cell types. Moreover, in vivo studies report that aciclovir treatment can produce a survival benefit in HIV-1-infected patients and that recurrent genital herpes appears to be linked to HIV-1 transmission by both boosting plasma retroviral load and providing a portal of entry and exit for HIV-1.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) heterogeneity contributes to the emergence of drug-resistant virus, escape from host defense systems, and/or conversion of the cellular tropism. To establish an in vitro system to address a heterogeneous virus population, we constructed a library of HIV-1 molecular clones containing a set of random combinations of zero to 11 amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to protease inhibitors by the HIV-1 protease. The complexity (2.1 x 10(5)) of the HIV-1 library pNG-PRL was large enough to cover all of the possible combinations of zero to 11 amino acid substitutions (a total of 4,096 substitutions possible). The T-cell line MT-2 was infected with the HIV-1 library, and resistant viruses were selected after treatment by the protease inhibitor ritonavir (0.03 to 0.30 microM). The viruses that contained three to eight amino acid substitutions could be selected within 2 weeks. These results demonstrate that this HIV-1 library could serve as an alternative in vitro system to analyze the emergence of drug resistance and to evaluate the antiviral activity of novel compounds against multidrug-resistant viruses.\",\"HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 play an important role in viral entry and pathogenesis. To better understand the role of viral tropism in HIV-1 transmission, we examined the coreceptor utilization of viral isolates obtained from men enrolled in a study of heterosexual transmission in northern Thailand. Viral isolates were obtained from HIV-1-positive males who had either HIV-1-infected spouses (RM; n = 5) or HIV-1-uninfected spouses (HM; n = 10). Viral isolates from 1 of the 5 RM males and 2 of the 10 HM males were CCR5 tropic, whereas isolates from 3 RM males and 6 of the HM male isolates were CXCR4 tropic. Of the nine X4-tropic isolates, seven also used at least one of the following coreceptors: CCR8, CCR1, CCR2b, or CX3CR1, and none employed CCR5 as an additional coreceptor. More importantly, three isolates, RM-15, HM-13, and HM-16 (one from a transmitter and two from nontransmitter), did not infect GHOST4.cl.34 cells expressing any of the known coreceptors. Further analysis using MAGI-plaque assays, which allow visualization of infected cells, revealed that RM-15 had low numbers of infected cells in MAGI-R5 and MAGI-X4 cultures, whereas HM-13 and HM-16 had high levels of plaques in MAGI-X4 cultures. Replication kinetics using activated lymphocytes revealed that these three isolates replicated in CCR5(+/+) as well as CCR5(-/-) peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that these isolates did not have an absolute requirement of CCR5 for viral entry. All three isolates were sensitive to the X4-antagonistic compounds T-22 and AMD3100. Analysis of the C2V3 region did not reveal any significant structural differences between any of the Thai subtype E isolates. Thus, there was no association between the pattern of coreceptor usage and transmissibility among these subtype E HIV-1 isolates.\",\"Concanavalin A-immobilized polystyrene nanospheres (Con A-NS) were developed for the HIV-1 vaccine capable of preventing sexual transmission. Con A-NS could capture efficiently HIV-1 irrespective of their cell tropism (R5 or X4). Furthermore, Con A-NS captured equally infectious and heat-inactivated HIV-1. Inactivated HIV-1-capturing Con A-NS (HIV-NS) were intravaginally administered to mice. Heat-inactivated HIV-1 alone and Con A-NS alone were also administered as control immunogens. Vaginal fluids were collected during and after immunization and analyzed for their anti-HIV-1 antibody levels. Although the anti-HIV-1 IgG antibody was undetectable in any groups, increased anti-HIV-1 IgA antibody response was identified in the vaginal fluids of immunized mice with HIV-NS. The vaginal fluids obtained from the HIV-NS-administered mice showed neutralizing activity against the immunizing HIV-1 strain. A marked difference in vaginal distribution was observed between HIV-NS and other immunogens, and the toxicity of Con A was reduced by conjugation with nanospheres. Thus, HIV-NS may have great potential as a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine and should be examined further for its efficacy in non-human primates.\",\"Our previous study has shown that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope V3 region minor genotypes of infected mothers were transmitted to their infants and predominated initially as a homogeneous virus population in the infants (Ahmad N, Baroudy BM, Baker RC, et al.: J Virol 1995;69:1001-1012). Here we have characterized the biological properties, including cellular tropism, replication efficiency, cytopathic effects, and coreceptor utilization, of these V3 region isolates from mothers and infants. Nineteen V3 region sequences from three mother-infant pairs, including the minor variants of mothers and the major variants of infants as characterized in our previous study, were reciprocally inserted into an HIV-1 infectious molecular clone, pNL4-3, and chimeric viruses were generated by DNA transfections into HeLa cells. Equal amounts of chimeric viruses were then used to infect T lymphocyte cell lines (A3.01 and MT-2), primary blood lymphocytes (PBLs), primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and coreceptor cell lines. We found that the V3 region chimeras failed to replicate in T lymphocyte cell lines but replicated in MDMs and PBLs, albeit at reduced levels compared with R5 laboratory HIV-1 strains. In addition, the V3 region chimeras were able to infect the HOS-CD4(+)CCR5(+) cell line, suggesting CCR5 coreceptor utilization. Moreover, the V3 region chimeras were unable to induce syncytia in MT-2 cells, indicative of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotypes. In conclusion, the HIV-1 minor genotypes of infected mothers with macrophage-tropic and NSI or R5 phenotypes are transmitted to their infants and are initially maintained with the same properties.\",\"We describe replication-competent, vaccine strain-based rabies viruses (RVs) that lack their own single glycoprotein and express, instead, a chimeric RV-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein composed of the ectodomain and transmembrane domains of HIV-1 gp160 and the cytoplasmic domain of RV G. The envelope proteins from both X4 (NL4-3)- and R5X4 (89.6)-tropic HIV-1 strains were utilized. These recombinant viruses very closely mimicked an HIV-1- like tropism, as indicated by blocking experiments. Infection was inhibited by SDF-1 on cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4 for both viruses, whereas RANTES abolished infection of cells expressing CCR5 in addition to CD4 in studies of the RV expressing HIV-1(89.6) Env. In addition, preincubation with soluble CD4 or monoclonal antibodies directed against HIV-1 gp160 blocked the infectivity of both G-deficient viruses but did not affect the G-containing RVs. Our results also indicated that the G-deficient viruses expressing HIV-1 envelope protein, in contrast to wild-type RV but similar to HIV-1, enter cells by a pH-independent pathway. As observed for HIV-1, the surrogate viruses were able to target human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and immature and mature human dendritic cells (DC). Moreover, G-containing RV-based vectors also infected mature human DC, indicating that infection of these cells is also supported by RV G. The ability of RV-based vectors to infect professional antigen-presenting cells efficiently further emphasizes the potential use of recombinant RVs as vaccines.\",\"Previous findings indicated that HLA-DR is probably one of the most abundant cellular constituents incorporated within the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope. Given that the life-cycle of HIV-1 has been reported to be modulated by virion-bound host HLA-DR, an improved version of a virus capture technique was developed to assess the degree of HLA-DR incorporation in several clinical isolates of HIV-1 derived from primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Analysis of virus stocks purified from PBMCs and MDM indicated that primary isolates of HIV-1 bearing distinct tropism (i.e. T-, macrophage-, and dual-tropic) all incorporate host cell membrane HLA-DR protein. The amount of incorporated HLA-DR varies among the primary HIV-1 isolates tested. Propagation of some clinical HIV-1 isolates in either autologous PBMCs or MDM resulted in differential incorporation of virion-bound cellular HLA-DR depending on the nature of the virus producer cells. Differences in the degree of HLA-DR incorporation were also noticed when macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1 were produced in MDM from different donors. Altogether these data show that the efficiency of HLA-DR incorporation into the envelope of primary isolates of HIV-1 is a multifactorial phenomenon since it is affected by the virus isolate itself, the nature of host cells (i.e. PBMCs or MDM) and the donor source.\",\"HIV virus particles interact with several receptors on cell surfaces. Two receptors, CD4 and a co-receptor act sequentially to trigger fusion of viral and cellular membranes and confer virus entry into cells. For HIV-1, the chemokine receptor CCR5 is the predominant co-receptor exploited for transmission and replication in vivo. Variants that switch to use CXCR4 and perhaps other co-receptors evolve in some infected individuals and have altered tropism and pathogenic properties. Other cell surface receptors including mannose binding protein on macrophages and DC-SIGN on dendritic cells also interact with gp120 on virus particles but do not actively promote fusion and virus entry. These receptors may tether virus particles to cells enabling interactions with suboptimal concentrations of CD4 and/or co-receptors. Alternatively such receptors may transport cell surface trapped virions into lymph nodes before transmitting them to susceptible cells. Therapeutic strategies that prevent HIV from interacting with receptors are currently being developed. This review describes how the interaction and use of different cellular receptors influences HIV tropism and pathogenesis in vivo.\",\"DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin expressed on dendritic cells and restricted macrophage populations in vivo that binds gp120 and acts in trans to enable efficient infection of T cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We report here that DC-SIGN, when expressed in cis with CD4 and coreceptors, allowed more efficient infection by both HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains, although the extent varied from 2- to 40-fold, depending on the virus strain. Expression of DC-SIGN on target cells did not alleviate the requirement for CD4 or coreceptor for viral entry. Stable expression of DC-SIGN on multiple lymphoid lines enabled more efficient entry and replication of R5X4 and X4 viruses. Thus, 10- and 100-fold less 89.6 (R5/X4) and NL4-3 (X4), respectively, were required to achieve productive replication in DC-SIGN-transduced Jurkat cells when compared to the parental cell line. In addition, DC-SIGN expression on T-cell lines that express very low levels of CCR5 enabled entry and replication of R5 viruses in a CCR5-dependent manner, a property not exhibited by the parental cell lines. Therefore, DC-SIGN expression can boost virus infection in cis and can expand viral tropism without affecting coreceptor preference. In addition, coexpression of DC-SIGN enabled some viruses to use alternate coreceptors like STRL33 to infect cells, whereas in its absence, infection was not observed. Immunohistochemical and confocal microscopy data indicated that DC-SIGN was coexpressed and colocalized with CD4 and CCR5 on alveolar macrophages, underscoring the physiological significance of these cis enhancement effects.\",\"The V3 hypervariable region of HIV-1 surface protein has been identified as a major determinant for viral tropism and coreceptor usage. However, the role of the highly conserved N-linked glycan at the V3 loop remains controversial. To further examine its role in viral infection, we introduced a conservative amino acid substitution (asparagine to glutamine) in the V3-proximal glycosylation motif (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the surface glycoprotein of a CXCR4-using virus (BRU), a CCR5-using virus (SF162), and a dual-tropic virus (89.6). The effect of the mutation was determined by complementation assays, and by infectivity on CEMx174 and U373-MAGI cells expressing either CXCR4 or CCR5. The mutation resulted in decreased CXCR4 usage by SHIV89.6, but increased usage by BRU. Similarly, it abrogated CCR5 usage by SHIV89.6, but had no effect on SF162. This effect was not dependent on the specific amino acid substitution used, because a threonine-toalanine mutation in the same motif in 89.6 Env yielded identical results as the asparagine-to-glutamine mutation. These findings support the notion that multiple factors, including glycosylation at V3, contribute to coreceptor usage and that the particular effects exerted by the N-linked glycan itself appear to be isolate dependent.\",\"The predictive value of positively charged amino acids at positions 11 and 25 within the V3 loop region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope gene for the syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype was assessed. Sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared from serial viral isolates from 10 HIV-1-seropositive subjects. Proviral DNA sequencing was also performed on biologic clones from most of these subjects. Positive charge at position 11 and/or 25 in 257 isolate cDNA, PBMC DNA, and biologic clone PBMC DNA sequences was compared with 69 phenotypic determinations, of which 62.3% were SI. V3 genotype was 51.2% sensitive and 85.8% specific for the SI phenotype, with positive and negative predictive values of 62.8% and 79.0%, respectively. Cellular tropism failed to correlate with V3 genotype, coreceptor use, or biologic phenotype. Exclusive use of CCR5 was associated with the nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype. Overall, V3 loop charge was higher in SI than in NSI isolates (5.01 and 3.78, respectively; p = 0.0211). The predictive power of SI phenotype from V3 genotype is relatively weak, especially in a low SI prevalence population. The direct measurement of viral phenotype, cellular tropism, and coreceptor use in HIV-1 isolates is essential for accurate biologic characterization.\",\"The Th1/Th2 model provides an interesting paradigm for understanding several pathophysiological processes and possibly for developing new immunotherapeutical strategies. In HIV-1 infection the interaction between the type of HIV-1 strain and the pathway of the ongoing T-cell effector response, despite its complexity, may represent one of the crucial mechanisms in determining the outcome of virus infection. While the possibility of an HIV-1-driven Th1 to Th2 switch of the immune response is still debated, evidence is accumulating to suggest that cytokines produced during an immune response can contribute to promote a selective pressure toward the evolution of HIV-1 viral strains with different tropism. This article summarizes the results of our recent studies in which the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 HIV-1 co-receptors, as well as the activity of R5- or X4- tropic strains of HIV-1 in different in vitro models of Th1/Th2 polarization was analyzed.\",\"Infection of microglia and other cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage in the central nervous system (CNS) by human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) underlies the development of giant cell encephalitis (GCE). It is currently unknown whether GCE depends on the emergence of virus populations specifically adapted to replicate in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and whether this also leads to the specific targeting of macrophages in other nonlymphoid tissues. Autopsy samples from lymph node, brain (frontal region), lung, and full-thickness colon sections were obtained from nine study subjects with GCE and from nine without. The two groups showed no significant differences in CD4 counts, disease progression, or treatment history before death. Genetic relatedness between variants recovered from lymph node and nonlymphoid tissues was assessed by sequence comparison of V3 and p17(gag) regions using a newly developed method that scores the sample composition at successive nodes in a neighbor-joining tree. The association index enabled objective, numerical comparisons on the degree of tissue compartmentalization to be made. High proviral loads and p24 antigen expression in the brain were confined to the nine individuals with GCE. GCE was also associated with significantly higher proviral loads in colon samples (median of the GCE(+) group: 1,010 copies/10(6) cells; median of GCE(-) group, 10/10(6) cells; P = 0.006). In contrast, there were no significant differences in proviral load between the GCE(+) and GCE(-) groups in lymph node or lung samples, where HIV infection was manifested predominantly by infiltrates of lymphoid cells. V3 sequences from brain samples of individuals with GCE showed the greatest compartmentalization from those of lymph node, although samples from other tissues, particularly the colon, frequently contained variants phylogenetically related to those found in brain. The existence of shared, distinct populations of HIV specifically distributed in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage was further indicated by immunocytochemical detection of CD68(+), multinucleated giant cells expressing p24 antigen in samples of lung and colon in two individuals with GCE. This study provides the basis for future investigation of possible phenotypic similarities that underline the shared distributions of HIV variants infecting microglia and tissue macrophages outside the CNS.\",\"Determine the in vivo effect of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) on: (a) the titre of infectious virus circulating in blood; and (b) the chemokine co-receptor usage of these viruses. A longitudinal study of 62 patients over 8 years. The results for PCP were compared with those for disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) and acute herpes simplex virus type 1 infections (HSV). Blood was collected every 3-4 months when patients were well, and again when they were acutely ill. A tissue culture based PHA/IL-2 induced HIV replication assay was used to determine the frequency of circulating cells in blood carrying infectious forms of HIV-1. Viral isolates were phenotyped using U87 cells transfected with CD4 and a chemokine co-receptor. There were 29 cases of PCP, 18 cases of HSV and 11 cases of CMV. A significant increase in the viral replication assay was seen during severe PCP but not during HSV or CMV infections. The number of chemokine co-receptors being used by HIV-1 increased during severe PCP to include CXCR4 and CCR3 in three of six patients from whom viruses were available for detailed study. Severe PCP can increase the number of PBMN cells containing integrated, replication competent, infectious forms of HIV-1 circulating in blood. The expanded chemokine co-receptor tropism of these viral isolates could promote the dissemination of HIV-1 from lymphoid to non-lymphoid organs and explain the poor prognosis of patients who develop severe PCP.\",\"The viral determinants that underlie human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neurotropism are unknown, due in part to limited studies on viruses isolated from brain. Previous studies suggest that brain-derived viruses are macrophage tropic (M-tropic) and principally use CCR5 for virus entry. To better understand HIV-1 neurotropism, we isolated primary viruses from autopsy brain, cerebral spinal fluid, blood, spleen, and lymph node samples from AIDS patients with dementia and HIV-1 encephalitis. Isolates were characterized to determine coreceptor usage and replication capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and microglia. Env V1/V2 and V3 heteroduplex tracking assay and sequence analyses were performed to characterize distinct variants in viral quasispecies. Viruses isolated from brain, which consisted of variants that were distinct from those in lymphoid tissues, used CCR5 (R5), CXCR4 (X4), or both coreceptors (R5X4). Minor usage of CCR2b, CCR3, CCR8, and Apj was also observed. Primary brain and lymphoid isolates that replicated to high levels in MDM showed a similar capacity to replicate in microglia. Six of 11 R5 isolates that replicated efficiently in PBMC could not replicate in MDM or microglia due to a block in virus entry. CD4 overexpression in microglia transduced with retroviral vectors had no effect on the restricted replication of these virus strains. Furthermore, infection of transfected cells expressing different amounts of CD4 or CCR5 with M-tropic and non-M-tropic R5 isolates revealed a similar dependence on CD4 and CCR5 levels for entry, suggesting that the entry block was not due to low levels of either receptor. Studies using TAK-779 and AMD3100 showed that two highly M-tropic isolates entered microglia primarily via CXCR4. These results suggest that HIV-1 tropism for macrophages and microglia is restricted at the entry level by a mechanism independent of coreceptor specificity. These findings provide evidence that M-tropism rather than CCR5 usage predicts HIV-1 neurotropism.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiological agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), shows a variety of biological properties, which may constitute an obstacle to development of effective vaccines or antiretroviral therapy. To characterize Brazilian strains of HIV-1, we studied 24 viruses isolated from blood samples of HIV-1-positive patients from different regions of the country. To examine the cell tropism and the virus ability to form syncytia, primary macrophages and the CD4+ T cell line MT-2 were infected with these viruses. We found that 22 isolates replicated well in macrophages (macrophage-tropic isolates), 2 infected only MT-2 cells (T cell line tropic variants), while 6 of them grew in both cells. We found 8 syncytium-inducing (SI) and 16 non-SI (NSI) isolates. Continuous cultures of 18 isolates were established in the CCR5+/CXCR4+ cell line PM-1, and SI/NSI features of these viruses were confirmed by cell fusion assay with uninfected CD4+ T cell lines (PM-1, MT-2, H9, and SUP-T1). The coreceptor usage of 18 isolates was investigated by infecting U87 cells transfected with CD4 and chemokine receptors, and we found that 11 isolates infected only CCR5+ cells, 3 only CXCR4+ cells, whereas 4 used both coreceptors. We also observed that X4 isolates were more sensitive to neutralization by dextran sulfate than R5 or R5X4 viruses. Our findings show that the Brazilian isolates are phenotypically similar to those prevalent in other regions, which could mean that therapeutic strategies based on HIV-1 phenotypic properties would be efficient in Brazil, as in other countries.\",\"The envelope gene, especially the V(3) region, of HIV-1 has been shown to be a principal determinant of cell tropism, replication and cytopathogenicity of the virus. In addition, the V(1)/V(2) region of the envelope gene has been found to be an important factor in cell tropism. We examined the compatibility between the V(1)/V(2) and C(2)-V(3) domains of HIV-1 gp120 in different combinations on viral replication by using envelope recombinants between ME1 and ME46, two infectious molecular clones with diverse biologic activity longitudinally isolated from one seropositive subject. Our data demonstrate that a proper interaction between the regions of V(1)/V(2)and C(2) is essential for viral infection and hence replication. Sequence analysis and subsequent site directed mutagenesis study indicate that the pattern of potential envelope N-glycosylation in the V(1)/V(2) and C(2)-V(3) regions may be the determining factor in such interaction between these two regions. It is possible that improper N-glycosylation sites while not affecting virus assembly, can influence through steric hindrance the conformational change of the V(3) region that is required for the co-receptor attachment and hence the viral infectivity.\",\"We have assembled two sets of HIV-1 V3 sequences with defined epidemiologic relationships associated with experimentally determined coreceptor usage or MT-2 cell tropism. These data sets were used for three purposes. First, they were employed to test existing methods for predicting coreceptor usage and MT-2 cell tropism. Of these methods, the presence of one basic amino acid at position 11 or 25 proved to be most reliable for both phenotypic classifications, although its predictive power for the X4 phenotype was less than 50%. Second, we used the sequence sets to train neural networks to infer coreceptor usage from V3 genotype with better success than the best available motif-based method, and with a predictive power equal to that of the best motif-based method for MT-2 cell tropism. Third, we used the sequence sets to reexamine patterns of variability associated with the different phenotypes, and we showed that the phenotype-associated sequence patterns could be reproduced from large sets of V3 sequences using phenotypes predicted by the trained neural network.\",\"The major human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptors are the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. The patterns of expression of the major coreceptors and their use by HIV-1 strains largely explain viral tropism at the level of entry. However, while virus infection is dependent upon the presence of CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor, it can be influenced by a number of factors, including receptor concentration, affinity between envelope gp120 and receptors, and potentially receptor conformation. Indeed, seven-transmembrane domain receptors, such as CCR5, can exhibit conformational heterogeneity, although the significance for virus infection is uncertain. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to CXCR4, we found that CXCR4 on both primary and transformed T cells as well as on primary B cells exhibited considerable conformational heterogeneity. The conformational heterogeneity of CXCR4 explains the cell-type-dependent ability of CXCR4 antibodies to block chemotaxis to stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha and to inhibit HIV-1 infection. In addition, the MAb most commonly used to study CXCR4 expression, 12G5, recognizes only a subpopulation of CXCR4 molecules on all primary cell types analyzed. As a result, CXCR4 concentrations on these important cell types have been underestimated to date. Finally, while the factors responsible for altering CXCR4 conformation are not known, we found that they do not involve CXCR4 glycosylation, sulfation of the N-terminal domain of CXCR4, or pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein coupling. The fact that this important HIV-1 coreceptor exists in multiple conformations could have implications for viral entry and for the development of receptor antagonists.\",\"The molecular mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into cells involves specific interactions between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 and two target cell proteins, CD4 and either CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors. In order to delineate the functional role of HIV-1 gp120 subdomains of dualtropic strains in CCR5 coreceptor usage, we used a panel of chimeric viruses in which the V1/V2 and V3 domains of gp120 from the dualtropic HIV-1(KMT) isolate were introduced either alone or in combination into the T-tropic HIV-1(NL4-3) background. These chimeric constructs were employed in cell-cell fusion and cell-free virus infectivity assays using cell lines expressing CD4 and the CCR5 chemokine receptor. In both assays, the V3 domain of HIV-1(KMT) but not the V1/V2 domain proved to be the principal determinant of CCR5 coreceptor usage. However, in the cell-free viral infectivity assay although a chimeric virus with a combined V1/V2 and V3 domains of HIV-1(KMT) efficiently fused with coreceptor expressing cells, yet its infectivity was markedly diminished in CCR5 as well as CXCR4 expressing cells. Restoring a comparable level of infection of such chimeric virus required the C3-V5 domain from HIV-1(KMT) to be introduced. Our present findings confirmed that the V3 domain is the major determinant of fusion activity and cellular tropism, and demonstrated a dispensable role for the V1/V2 domain. In addition the C3-V5 domain appeared to play an important role in viral infectivity when the corresponding V1/V2 and V3 domains are present.\",\"Recent studies have shown that two CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) sites are critically important for efficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) replication within cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, a primary cell type infected by HIV-1 and a potentially important vehicle for transport of virus to the central nervous system (CNS). Given the relevance of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation with respect to HIV-1 replication within monocyte populations and the important role that monocyte tropism likely plays in HIV-1 infection of the brain, C/EBP site sequence variation was examined within peripheral blood- and brain-derived LTR populations. Brain-derived LTRs commonly possessed a C/EBP site I configuration (6G, comprised of a thymidine to guanosine substitution with respect to the clade B consensus sequence at position 6 of C/EBP site I) that leads to enhanced binding of C/EBP proteins over that observed with the HIV-1 clade B consensus sequence at this site. In contrast, the 6GC/EBP site I configuration appeared infrequently within sequenced peripheral blood-derived LTRs. In addition, C/EBP site II was even more highly conserved in brain-derived HIV-1 LTR populations than site I. This was not the case with peripheral blood-derived LTR C/EBP site II sequences. The high degree of C/EBP site II conservation in brain-derived LTRs was likely important in LTR regulation since the clade B consensus sequence conserved at C/EBP site II recruited high amounts of C/EBP family members. Transient transfection analyses indicated that conservation of the strong C/EBP site II in brain-derived LTRs was likely due to important interactions with Tat. Overall, brain-derived HIV-1 LTRs preferentially contained two highly reactive C/EBP binding sites, which may suggest that these sites play important roles in LTR-directed transcription during invasion and maintenance of HIV-1 in the central nervous system.\",\"The presence or absence of the receptor CD4 and the coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4 restrict the cell tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Despite the importance of thymic infection by HIV-1, conflicting reports regarding the expression of HIV-1 coreceptors on human thymocytes have not been resolved. We assayed the expression and function of the major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, as well as CCR4 and CCR7 as controls, on human thymocytes. We detected CCR5 on 2.5% of thymocytes, CXCR4 on 53% of the cells, and CCR4 on 16% and CCR7 on 11% of human thymocytes. Moreover, infection by R5 HIV-1 did not significantly induce expression of CCR5. We found that two widely used anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with CCR8, which may account for discrepancies among published reports of CCR5 expression on primary cells. This cross-reactivity could be eliminated by deletion of amino acids 2 through 4 of CCR8. Chemotaxis assays showed that SDF-1, which binds CXCR4; MDC, which binds CCR4; and ELC, which binds CCR7, mediated significant chemotaxis of thymocytes. In contrast, MIP-1beta, whose receptor is CCR5, did not induce significant chemotaxis. Our results indicate that CXCR4, CCR4, CCR7, and their chemokine ligands may be involved in thymocyte migration during development in the thymus. CCR5 and its ligands, however, are likely not involved in these processes. Furthermore, the pattern of CCR5 and CXCR4 expression that we found may explain the greater susceptibility of human thymocytes to infection by HIV-1 isolates capable of using CXCR4 in cell entry compared to those that use only CCR5.\",\"Analysis of viral replication and pathogenicity after in vivo selection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) attenuated in vitro will help to define the functions involved in replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Using the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse and human fetal thymus organ culture as in vivo models, we previously defined HIV-1 env determinants (HXB2/LW) which were reverted for replication in vivo (L. Su et al., Virology 227:46-52, 1997). In this study, we examined the replication of four highly related HIV-1 clones directly derived from Lai/IIIB or after selection in vivo to investigate the envelope gp120 determinants associated with replication in macrophages and in the thymus models in vivo. The LW/C clone derived from the IIIB-infected laboratory worker and HXB2/LW both efficiently infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and the human thymus. Although the laboratory worker (LW) isolates showed altered tropism from IIIB, they still predominantly used CXCR4 as coreceptors for infecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and the thymus. Interestingly, a single amino acid mutation in the V3 loop associated with resistance to neutralizing antibodies was also essential for the replication activity of the LW virus in the thymus models but not for its activity in infecting MDM. The LW virions were equally sensitive to a CXCR4 antagonist. We further demonstrated that the LW HIV-1 isolate selected in vivo produced more infectious viral particles that contained higher levels of the Env protein gp120. Thus, selection of the laboratory-attenuated Lai/IIIB isolate in vivo leads to altered tropism but not coreceptor usage of the virus. The acquired replication activity in vivo is correlated with an early A-to-T mutation in the V3 loop and increased virion association of HIV-1 Env gp120, but it is genetically separable from the acquired replication activity in macrophages.\",\"The gastrointestinal mucosa harbors the majority of the body's CD4(+) cells and appears to be uniquely susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We undertook this study to examine the role of differences in chemokine receptor expression on infection of mucosal mononuclear cells (MMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1. We performed in vitro infections of MMCs and PBMCs with R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1, engineered to express murine CD24 on the infected cell's surface, allowing for quantification of HIV-infected cells and their phenotypic characterization. A greater percentage of MMCs than PBMCs are infected by both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1. Significant differences exist in terms of chemokine receptor expression in the blood and gastrointestinal mucosa; mucosal cells are predominantly CCR5(+) CXCR4(+), while these cells make up less than 20% of the peripheral blood cells. It is this cell population that is most susceptible to infection with both R5- and X4-tropic HIV-1 in both compartments. Regardless of whether viral isolates were derived from the blood or mucosa of HIV-1-infected patients, HIV-1 p24 production was greater in MMCs than in PBMCs. Further, the chemokine receptor tropism of these patient-derived viral isolates did not differ between compartments. We conclude that, based on these findings, the gastrointestinal mucosa represents a favored target for HIV-1, in part due to its large population of CXCR4(+) CCR5(+) target cells and not to differences in the virus that it contains.\",\"We investigated the production efficiency and the gene transfer capacity in the central nervous system of HIV-1-based vectors pseudotyped with either the G protein of the Mokola lyssaviruses (MK-G), a neurotropic virus causing rabies disease, or the vesiculo-stomatitis G protein (VSV-G). Both envelopes induced syncitia in cell cultures. They were incorporated into vector particles and mature virions were observed by electron microscopy. Vector production was two- to sixfold more efficient with VSV-G than with MK-G. For equivalent amounts of physical particles, vector titration was 5- to 25-fold higher with VSV-G than with MK-G pseudotypes on cultured cells, and in vivo gene expression in mouse brain was more intense. Thus, VSV-G pseudotypes were produced more efficiently and were more infectious than MK-G pseudotypes. Tropism for brain cells was analyzed by intrastriatal injections in rats. Both pseudotypes preferentially transduced neurons (70-90% of transduced cells). Retrograde axonal transport was investigated by instilling vector suspensions in the rat nasal cavity. Both pseudotypes were efficiently transported to olfactive neuron bodies. Thus, although coating HIV-1 particles with rabdhovirus envelope glycoproteins enables them to enter neuronal cells efficiently, pseudotyping is not sufficient to confer the powerful neurotropism of lyssaviruses to lentivirus vectors.\",\"Laboratory isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that utilize CXCR4 as a coreceptor infect primary human macrophages inefficiently even though these express a low but detectable level of cell surface CXCR4. In contrast, infection of primary macrophages by primary CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates is readily detectable. Here, we provide evidence suggesting that this difference in cell tropism results from a higher requirement for cell surface CXCR4 for infection by laboratory HIV-1 isolates. Transfected COS7 cells that express a high level of CD4 but a low level of CXCR4 were infected significantly more efficiently by two primary CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates compared to the prototypic laboratory HIV-1 isolate IIIB. More importantly, overexpression of either wild-type or signaling-defective CXCR4 on primary macrophages dramatically enhanced the efficiency of infection by the laboratory HIV-1 isolate yet only modestly enhanced infection by either primary CXCR4-tropic virus. Overexpression of CD4 had, in contrast, only a limited effect on macrophage infection by the laboratory HIV-1, although infection by the primary isolates was markedly enhanced. We therefore conclude that the laboratory CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolate exhibits a significantly higher CXCR4 requirement for efficient infection than do the primary CXCR4-tropic isolates and that this difference can explain the poor ability of the laboratory HIV-1 isolate to replicate in primary macrophages. More generally, we propose that the cell tropisms displayed by different strains of HIV-1 in culture can largely be explained on the basis of differential requirements for cell surface CD4 and/or coreceptor expression levels.\",\"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) develops through discrete inflammatory-angiogenic stages of polyclonal nature (early-stage lesions) to monomorphic nodules of spindle-shaped cells that can be clonal (late-stage lesions) and resemble true sarcomas. Molecular and epidemiological studies indicate that development of KS is tightly associated with infection by the human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). However, only individuals with specific conditions of immunodysregulation develop KS. In these individuals the systemic and tissue increase of Th-1-type cytokines (IC) reactivate HHV-8 infection, leading to increased viral load, antibody titers, and an expanded cell tropism that precedes the clinical appearance of KS. Recruitment of the virus into tissues by infected monocytes and other cell types is facilitated by the endothelial cell activation due to IC. In clinical lesions, HHV-8 infection increases with lesion stage and in late-stage lesions most of the spindle cells are latently infected, whereas only few lyrically infected cells are present, suggesting that latent genes may have a role in the transformation of the early inflammatory-hyperplastic lesion into a real sarcoma. The development of tumors, however, is regulated through a multistep process based on the acquisition by cells of several different capabilities leading to malignant growth. Here we review the available data on the expression of HHV-8-encoded genes in primary KS lesions and, in view of their biological activity, analyze their potential function in different steps of tumorigenesis. By this pragmatic approach interesting insights into potential key functions of HHV-8-encoded genes are found and steps of potential cooperativity with other viral factors (HIV-1-Tat) in the pathogenesis of KS are identified.\",\"Passive antibody prophylaxis against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been accomplished in primates, suggesting that this strategy may prove useful in humans. While antibody specificity is crucial for neutralization, other antibody characteristics, such as subclass, have not been explored. Our objective was to compare the efficiencies of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses from polyclonal human HIV immune globulin (HIVIG) in the neutralization of HIV-1 strains differing in coreceptor tropism. IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 were enriched from HIVIG by using protein A-Sepharose. All three subclasses bound major HIV-1 proteins, as shown by Western blot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In HIV-1 fusion assays using X4, R5, or X4R5 envelope-expressing effector cells, IgG3 more efficiently blocked fusion. In neutralization assays with cell-free viruses using X4 (LAI, IIIB), R5 (BaL), and X4R5 (DH123), a similar hierarchy of neutralization was found: IgG3 > IgG1 > IgG2. IgG3 has a longer, more flexible hinge region than the other subclasses. To test whether this is important, IgG1 and IgG3 were digested with pepsin to generate F(ab')(2) fragments or with papain to generate Fab fragments. IgG3 F(ab')(2) fragments were still more efficient in neutralization than F(ab')(2) of IgG1. However, Fab fragments of IgG3 and IgG1 demonstrated equivalent neutralization capacities and the IgG3 advantage was lost. These results suggest that the IgG3 hinge region confers enhanced HIV-neutralizing ability. Enrichment and stabilization of IgG3 may therefore lead to improved HIVIG preparations. The results of this study have implications for the improvement of passive immunization with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and suggest that HIV-1 vaccines which induce high-titer IgG3 responses could be advantageous.\",\"The envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is extensively glycosylated, containing approximately 23 asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites on its gp120 subunit. In this study, specific glycosylation sites on gp120 of a dualtropic primary HIV-1 isolate, DH12, were eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis and the properties of the resulting mutant envelopes were evaluated using a recombinant vaccinia virus-based cell-to-cell fusion assay alone or in the context of viral infections. Of the glycosylation sites that were evaluated, those proximal to the V1/V2 loops (N135, N141, N156, N160) and the V3 loops (N301) of gp120 were functionally critical. The glycosylation site mutations near the V1/V2 loop compromised the use of CCR5 and CXCR4 equally. In contrast, a mutation within the V3 loop preferentially inhibited the usage of CCR5; although this mutant protein completely lost its CCR5-dependent fusion activity, it retained 50% of the wild-type fusion activity with CXCR4. The replication of a virus containing this mutation was severely compromised in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, MT-4 cells, and primary monocyte-derived macrophages. A revertant virus, which acquired second site changes in the V3 loop that resulted in an increase in net positive charge, was isolated. The revertant virus fully recovered the usage of CXCR4 but not of CCR5, thereby altering the tropism of the parental virus from dualtropic to T-tropic. These results suggest that carbohydrate moieties near the V1/V2 and the V3 loops play critical roles in maintaining proper conformation of the variable loops for optimal interaction with receptors. Our results, combined with those of previously reported studies, further demonstrate that the function of individual glycans may be virus isolate dependent.\",\"In contrast to human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and type 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) rarely uses CXCR4 (X4) for efficient entry into target cells. Basic amino acid residues in the V3 loop of HIV Env allow efficient coreceptor utilization of X4. Therefore, we investigated if similar changes in the SIVmac Env protein also mediate a coreceptor switch from CCR5 (R5) to X4. Functional analysis revealed that none of eight SIVmac variants, containing V3 regions with an overall charge between +4 and +10, efficiently utilized X4 as entry cofactor. Nonetheless, these alterations had differential effects on SIV coreceptor tropism and on Env expression levels. A single amino acid substitution of L328R, located near the tip of the V3 loop, resulted in grossly reduced Env expression levels and impaired viral infectivity. Notably, additional basic residues restored efficient Env expression and virion incorporation but not infectivity. In comparison to the L328R mutation, changes of P334K and D337K had little disruptive effects on SIVmac entry and replication. Interestingly, mutation of L320K and P321R disrupted coreceptor usage of GPR15 but not R5. These changes also impaired SIVmac replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from a Delta32/Delta32 donor but not in R5-expressing human or simian PBMC. Our results show that positively charged amino acid residues in the V3 loop affect SIVmac coreceptor tropism and infectivity but do not allow efficient utilization of X4.\",\"Interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope and the relevant chemokine receptors is crucial for subsequent membrane fusion and viral entry. Although the V3 region of gp120 is known to determine the cell tropism as well as the coreceptor usage, the significance of the binding of the V3 region to the chemokine receptor has not been fully understood. To address this issue, we adopted the pseudotyped virus infection assay in which the V3 region of the T-cell line-tropic (T-tropic) NL4-3 envelope was replaced with a portion of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), the ligand of CXCR4. The V3 region of the NL4-3 envelope expression vector was replaced with three different stretches of SDF-1 cDNA. Expression of each chimeric envelope protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Luciferase reporter viruses were prepared by cotransfection of the pNL4-3.Luc.E(-)R(-) vector and each chimeric envelope expression vector, and the infection assay was then carried out. We showed that pseudotyped viruses with one of the chimeric envelopes, NL4-3/SDF1-51, could infect U87.CD4.CXCR4 but not U87.CD4 or U87.CXCR4 cells and that this infection was inhibited by the ligand of CXCR4, SDF-1beta, by anti-human SDF-1 antibody, or by an anti-CD4 antibody, Leu3a, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, chimeric NL4-3/SDF1-51 gp120 significantly inhibited binding of labeled SDF-1 to CXCR4. It was suggested that replacement of the V3 region of the NL4-3 envelope with SDF-1 preserved the CD4-dependent infectivity of T-tropic HIV-1. These results indicate that binding between the V3 region and the relevant coreceptor is important for viral entry, whether its amino acid sequence is indigenous to the virus or not.\",\"Several factors appear to affect vertical HIV-1 transmission, dependent mainly on characteristics of the mother (extent of immunodeficiency, co-infections, risk behaviour, nutritional status, immune response, genetical make-up), but also of the virus (phenotype, tropism) and, possibly, of the child (genetical make-up). This complex situation is compounded by the fact that the virus may have the whole gestation period, apart from variable periods between membrane rupture and birth and the breast-feeding period, to pass from the mother to the infant. It seems probable that an extensive interplay of all factors occurs, and that some factors may be more important during specific periods and other factors in other periods. Factors predominant in protection against in utero transmission may be less important for peri-natal transmission, and probably quite different from those that predominantly affect transmission by mothers milk. For instance, cytotoxic T lymphocytes will probably be unable to exert any effect during breast-feeding, while neutralizing antibodies will be unable to protect transmission by HIV transmitted through infected cells. Furthermore, some responses may be capable of controlling transmission of determined virus types, while being inadequate for controlling others. As occurrence of mixed infections and recombination of HIV-1 types is a known fact, it does not appear possible to prevent vertical HIV-1 transmission by reinforcing just one of the factors, and probably a general strategy including all known factors must be used. Recent reports have brought information on vertical HIV-1 transmission in a variety of research fields, which will have to be considered in conjunction as background for specific studies.\",\"The fibronectin fragment CH-296 improved gene transfer to cytokine-mobilized nonhuman primate CD34+ cells irrespective of tropism to the MoMLV, GaLV, and VSV-G envelope proteins using murine stem cell virus (MSCV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-based retrovirus vectors. For the HIV-1 lentivirus vector, CH-296 enhanced gene transfer in the absence of added hematopoietic growth factors necessary for ex vivo stem cell expansion. In the presence of CH-296, apoptosis of CD34+ cells was inhibited, and in mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ cells, cell division was stimulated as measured by cell history/tracking experiments.\",\"Early after seroconversion, macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants are predominantly found, even when a mixture of macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic variants was transmitted. For virus contracted by sexual transmission, this is presently explained by selection at the port of entry, where macrophages are infected and T cells are relatively rare. Here we explore an additional mechanism to explain the selection of macrophage-tropic variants in cases where the mucosa is bypassed during transmission, such as blood transfusion, needle-stick accidents, or intravenous drug abuse. With molecularly cloned primary isolates of HIV-1 in irradiated mice that had been reconstituted with a high dose of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we found that a macrophage-tropic HIV-1 clone escaped more efficiently from specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) pressure than its non-macrophage-tropic counterpart. We propose that CTLs favor the selective outgrowth of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 variants because infected macrophages are less susceptible to CTL activity than infected T cells.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses a coreceptor together with CD4 to enter CD4+ target cells. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 have been found to be the major coreceptors for T-cell line-tropic and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains, respectively, although many other chemokine and orphan receptors have also been identified as potential coreceptors for HIV-1. Genetic analyses has revealed the importance of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes in disease progression. The discovery of coreceptors provides a more defined scheme for virus entry in which the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein sequentially binds CD4 and coreceptor, leading to a membrane fusion reaction between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane of the target cell. It also provides the basis for HIV-1 cell tropism. The identification of HIV coreceptors provides new opportunities for the development of anti-HIV therapy. Many coreceptor-based therapeutic approaches have been developed, some of which are currently in clinical trials.\",\"We describe the production and properties of a permanent cell line, CEM.NKR-CCR5-Luc. This line is a derivative of the CEM.NKR-CCR5 line, stably transfected to express the luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of the HIV-2 LTR. Thus the cells respond to Tat expression during HIV-1 infection by producing luciferase, a protein that can be readily and accurately quantitated in a luminometer. The CEM.NKR-CCR5-Luc line expresses both the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors and can therefore be infected with a range of HIV-1 isolates, irrespective of their tropism properties. This is true of HIV-1 isolates from several genetic subtypes and also of a group O isolate. Furthermore, luciferase expression is also activated by infection of the cells with SIVmac239 or SIVmac251. We show that the CEM.NKR-CCR5-Luc cells can be used in assays of HIV-1 neutralization and also for identifying inhibitors of HIV-1 entry targeted at the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors. The luciferase end point simplifies the performance of neutralization and inhibitor-screening assays compared to the use of more conventional end points such as the detection of extracellular p24 antigen.\",\"A number of infected individuals develop neuropathological disorders, such as AIDS dementia complex (ADC), as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. The biological features governing HIV entry and tropism in different brain cell types remain unclear, as do the genetics of the virus regulating these events and the neuropathogenic processes within the brain tissues. HIV-1 was isolated from the right and left parietal, occipital, and frontal lobes of the brain cortex of three HIV-1-infected patients: two with ADC and one without. The viral strains were studied from the innate tissues and various primary cell cultures. The kinetics and tropism of viral strains from different brain regions showed clear differences on various primary cell types (monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and T cells), which could discriminate between biological behavior of HIV-1 strains from patients with and without ADC. The variable effect of different donor cells on tropism was also clearly evident. The majority (with a few exceptions) of isolates from different brain regions of all three patients used CCR5 as coreceptor for entry. The consistent CCR5 use, macrophage tropism, and non-syncytium-inducing phenotype were the main characteristics of the brain-derived HIV-1 strains from all three patients. Importantly, viral strains derived directly from innate brain tissue of the patient without ADC showed some differences from the cultured variants of the same patient, whereas those from brain tissue of the patients with ADC were more similar to the culture-adapted strains. This suggests that the emergence of primary cell type-adapted isolates during ADC may play a crucial role in the development and progression of the neuropathology associated with ADC. The different genotypes residing in different areas of brain combined with their differential tropism and coreceptor use suggest that neurotropic variants exist that may be governing the neurological manifestation of HIV disease in infected patients.\",\"NaN\",\"We developed a recombinant virus technique to determine the coreceptor usage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from plasma samples, the source expected to represent the most actively replicating virus population in infected subjects. This method is not subject to selective bias associated with virus isolation in culture, a step required for conventional tropism determination procedures. The addition of a simple subcloning step allowed semiquantitative evaluation of virus populations with a different coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) usage specificity present in each plasma sample. This procedure detected mixtures of CCR5- and CXCR4-exclusive virus populations as well as dualtropic viral variants, in variable proportions. Sequence analysis of dualtropic clones indicated that changes in the V3 loop are necessary for the use of CXCR4 as a coreceptor, but the overall context of the V1-V3 region is important to preserve the capacity to use CCR5. This convenient technique can greatly assist the study of virus evolution and compartmentalization in infected individuals.\",\"Changes in co-receptor-use by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains are relatively rare in vivo. Here we describe two variants derived from the CCR5-using strain SF162, selected for replication in the C8166 T-cell line. Amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop conferred CXCR4-use; however, the loss of macrophage-tropism by one variant was due to a single mutation in the start codon of vpu. We discuss how V3 loop and vpu mutations acquired by replication in T-cell lines in vitro correlate with similar changes reported for primary isolates and HIV-1 sequences in vivo.\",\"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), has claimed more than 10 million lives over the past 15 years. There are approximately 30 million HIV-positive people worldwide, 89% of whom reside in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The intricate relationship between the virus and HIV-related human multisystem pathology prompted scientists to modify many previously established concepts about infectious diseases and immunology, and to test new ones. The results of this work helped resolve many, albeit not all, long-standing problems concerning HIV-1 immune escape, its cellular tropism, and pathogenesis of HIV-related immunosuppression and nervous system disease. The most impressive advances have been made in antiretroviral drug treatment of HIV infection, which has resulted in dramatically reducing AIDS-related mortality, morbidity, and perinatal transmission. However, considering the magnitude of the worldwide HIV-AIDS pandemic, prohibitive cost and unusually exacting nature of combination drug treatment, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants, the disease and virus remain formidable and unpredictable, particularly in the area of prevention and vaccine development. Here, we have reviewed the most pertinent recently published studies of various aspects of HIV/AIDS intended to answer the following questions: what have we learned and what remains to be determined regarding this unorthodox viral disorder?\",\"The entry of primate immunodeficiency viruses into cells is dependent on the interaction of the viral envelope glycoproteins with receptors, CD4, and specific members of the chemokine receptor family. Although in many cases the tropism of these viruses is explained by the qualitative pattern of coreceptor expression, several instances have been observed where the expression of a coreceptor on the cell surface is not sufficient to allow infection by a virus that successfully utilizes the coreceptor in a different context. For example, both the T-tropic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239 and the macrophagetropic (M-tropic) SIVmac316 can utilize CD4 and CCR5 as coreceptors, and both viruses can infect primary T lymphocytes, yet only SIVmac316 can efficiently infect CCR5-expressing primary macrophages from rhesus monkeys. Likewise, M-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) do not infect primary rhesus monkey macrophages efficiently. Here we show that the basis of this restriction is the low level of CD4 on the surface of these cells. Overexpression of human or rhesus monkey CD4 in primary rhesus monkey macrophages allowed infection by both T-tropic and M-tropic SIV and by primary M-tropic HIV-1. By contrast, CCR5 overexpression did not specifically compensate for the inefficient infection of primary monkey macrophages by T-tropic SIV or M-tropic HIV-1. Apparently, the limited ability of these viruses to utilize a low density of CD4 for target cell entry accounts for the restriction of these viruses in primary rhesus monkey macrophages.\",\"The entry of enveloped viruses into its host cells is a crucial step for the propagation of viral infection. The envelope glycoprotein complex controls viral tropism and promotes the membrane fusion process. The surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses are synthesized as inactive precursors and sorted through the constitutive secretory pathway of the infected cells. To be infectious, most of the viruses require viral envelope glycoprotein maturation by host cell endoproteases. In spite of the strong variability of primary sequences observed within different viral envelope glycoproteins, the endoproteolytical cleavage occurs mainly in a highly conserved domain at the carboxy terminus of the basic consensus sequence (Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg downward arrow). The same consensus sequence is recognized by the kexin/subtilisin-like serine proteinases (so called convertases) in many cellular substrates such as prohormones, proprotein of receptors, plasma proteins, growth factors and bacterial toxins. Therefore, several groups of investigators have evaluated the implication of convertases in viral envelope glycoprotein cleavage. Using the vaccinia virus overexpression system, furin was first shown to mediate the proteolytic maturation of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and influenza virus envelope glycoproteins. In vitro studies demonstrated that purified convertases directly and specifically cleave viral envelope glycoproteins. Although these studies suggested the participation of several enzymes belonging to the convertases family, recent data suggest that other protease families may also participate in the HIV envelope glycoprotein processing. Their role in the physiological maturation process is still hypothetical and the molecular mechanism of the cleavage is not well documented. Crystallization of the hemagglutinin precursor (HA0) of influenza virus allowed further understanding of the molecular interaction between viral precursors and the cellular endoproteases. Furthermore, relationships between differential pathogenicity of influenza strains and their susceptibility to cleavage are molecularly funded. Here we review the most recent data and recent insights demonstrating the crucial role played by this activation step in virus infectivity. We discuss the cellular endoproteases that are implicated in HIV gp160 endoproteolytical maturation into gp120 and gp41.\",\"We demonstrated previously that CD45RA(+) CD4(+) T cells are infected primarily by syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 variants, whereas CD45RO(+) CD4(+) T cells harbor both non-SI (NSI) and SI HIV-1 variants. Here, we studied evolution of tropism for CD45RA(+) and CD45RO(+) CD4(+) cells, coreceptor usage, and molecular phylogeny of coexisting NSI and SI HIV-1 clones that were isolated from four patients in the period spanning SI conversion. NSI variants were CCR5-restricted and could be isolated throughout infection from CD45RO(+) CD4(+) cells. SI variants seemed to evolve in CD45RO(+) CD4(+) cells, but, in time, SI HIV-1 infection of CD45RA(+) CD4(+) cells equaled infection of CD45RO(+) CD4(+) cells. In parallel with this shift, SI HIV-1 variants first used both coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, but eventually lost the ability to use CCR5. Phylogenetically, NSI and SI HIV-1 populations diverged over time. We observed a differential expression of HIV-1 coreceptors within CD45RA(+) and CD45RO(+) cells, which allowed us to isolate virus from purified CCR5(+) CXCR4(-) and CCR5(-) CXCR4(+) CD4(+) cells. The CCR5(+) subset was exclusively infected by CCR5-dependent HIV-1 clones, whereas SI clones were preferentially isolated from the CXCR4(+) subset. The differential expression of HIV-1 coreceptors provides distinct cellular niches for NSI and SI HIV-1, contributing to their coexistence and independent evolutionary pathways.\",\"Chemokines and chemokine receptors play important roles in HIV-1 infection and tropism. CCR5 is the major macrophage-tropic coreceptor for HIV-1 whereas CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) serves the counterpart function for T cell-tropic viruses. An outstanding biological mystery is why only R5-HIV-1 is initially detected in new seroconvertors who are exposed to R5 and X4 viruses. Indeed, X4 virus emerges in a minority of patients and only in the late stage of disease, suggesting that early negative selection against HIV-1-CXCR4 interaction may exist. Here, we report that the HIV-1 Tat protein, which is secreted from virus-infected cells, is a CXCR4-specific antagonist. Soluble Tat selectively inhibited the entry and replication of X4, but not R5, virus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We propose that one functional consequence of secreted Tat is to select against X4 viruses, thereby influencing the early in vivo course of HIV-1 disease.\",\"The HIV envelope (Env) protein mediates entry into cells by binding CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor, which triggers structural changes in Env that lead to fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. The major HIV-1 coreceptors are the seven transmembrane domain chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. The type of coreceptor used by a virus strain is an important determinant of viral tropism and pathogenesis, and virus-receptor interactions can be therapeutic targets. However, Envs from many virus strains interact with CXCR4 and CCR5 with low affinity such that direct study of this important interaction is difficult if not impossible using standard cell-surface binding techniques. We have developed an approach that makes it possible to study ligand binding to membrane proteins, including Env-coreceptor interactions, using an optical biosensor. CCR5, CXCR4, and other membrane proteins were incorporated into retrovirus particles, which were purified and attached to the biosensor surface. Binding of conformationally sensitive antibodies as well as Env to these receptors was readily detected. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between an Env derived from the prototype HIV-1 strain IIIB for CXCR4 was approximately 500 nM, explaining the difficulty in measuring this interaction using standard equilibrium binding techniques. Retroviral pseudotypes represent easily produced, stable, homogenous structures that can be used to present a wide array of single and multiple membrane-spanning proteins in a native lipid environment for biosensor studies, thus avoiding the need for detergent solubilization, purification, and reconstitution. The approach should have general applicability and can be used to correlate Env-receptor binding constants to viral tropism and pathogenesis.\",\"We studied the replication of HIV-1 macrophage-tropic CCR5-using strains (R5) in CD4+ T cell lines to better understand the switch in co-receptor use of such strains during disease progression and to assess resulting changes in cell tropism. We found that the majority of R5 strains cannot replicate in CD4+ T cell lines without adaptation by serial passage. A small minority of primary R5 isolates, however, were able to infect two T cell lines, Molt4 and SupT1. This expanded tropism was due to the use of undetectable levels of CCR5 rather than CXCR4 or alternative receptors. In contrast, HIV-1sF162 adaptation for replication in the C8166 T cell line was due to the emergence of variant strains that could use CXCR4. Of two variants, one was dual-tropic and one T-tropic, although both could use CCR5 as well as CXCR4. A single mutation in the start codon of the accessory gene vpu accounted for the T-tropic phenotype of the second variant, indicating that a non-functional vpu impairs macrophage tropism. Thus, in vitro and in the absence of an immune response, R5 strains naturally adapt to infect CXCR4+ T cell lines. Such adaptation resembles the rare R5 to X4 switch that occurs in vivo. Mutations in accessory genes (e.g., vpu) not required for replication in rapidly dividing cell lines may also occur in vitro, abrogating replication in primary cell types such as macrophages. Such mutations, however, are normally selected against in vivo.\",\"A monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) culture assay was used to define the replication kinetics of HIV isolates. Ten-day-old MDMs were infected with HIV. Supernatants were collected and assayed for HIV p24 on days 3, 7, 10, and 14 post-infection (PI). In this assay, SF162 (macrophage tropic, NSI) produced increasing amounts of HIV p24 antigen with increasing time in culture. BRU (nonmacrophage tropic, SI) infection resulted in low levels of HIV p24 antigen with no increase in production during the culture period. A panel of 12 clinical isolates was evaluated. All isolates produced detectable levels of HIV p24 antigen in MDMs. However, the NSI viruses had significantly higher log10 HIV p24 antigen values at all times PI (P < 0.01). Co-receptor usage was determined for all 12 isolates (8 NSI and 4 SI). All SI isolates used CXCR4 for entry; two used CXCR4 only, one used CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR3, and one was a mixture of two isolates using CXCR4 and CCR5. None of the NSI viruses used CXCR4 for entry. All used CCR5 as their predominant co-receptor. Of the eight NSI isolates, three used CCR5 only, two used CCR5 and CCR2b, one used CCR5 and CCR3, and one used CCR5, CCR3, and CCR2b. Log10 HIV p24 antigen production on day 14 PI for viruses that used CCR5+CCR3 (3.79 + 1.40) was greater than for viruses that used CCR5+CCR2b (3.22 + 1.55) or CCR5 (3.32 + 1.49), and all were greater than those that used CXCR4 only (1.69 + 0.28), regardless of SI phenotype (P < 0.05). Thus, in these primary isolates, macrophage tropism and replication kinetics were closely linked to CCR5 utilization, whereas SI capacity was closely linked to CXCR4 utilization. Furthermore, viruses, which could use CCR5 and CCR3 for entry, had a replication advantage in macrophages, regardless of SI phenotype.\",\"To better understand CXCR4 function on macrophages and the relationship between coreceptor use and macrophage tropism among diverse HIV-1 isolates, we analyzed macrophage pathways involved in Env-mediated fusion, productive HIV-1 infection, and chemokine-elicited signaling. We found that both CXCR4 and CCR5 transduced intracellular signals in monocyte-derived macrophages, activating K+ and Cl- ion channels and elevating intracellular calcium in response to their chemokine ligands stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, respectively. The prototype T-tropic X4 strain IIIB infected macrophages poorly, and this was associated with failure of the IIIB Env to fuse efficiently with target macrophages despite functional CXCR4. In contrast, several primary X4 isolates mediated efficient CXCR4-dependent fusion and productive macrophage infection. Several R5X4 strains could fuse with and infect macrophages through both CCR5 and CXCR4. Thus, macrophages express functional CXCR4 and CCR5 but primary and prototype X4 isolates differ in their ability to utilize macrophage CXCR4. Isolates classified as X4 based on coreceptor use may be phenotypically either T-tropic or dual-tropic and, conversely, phenotypically dual-tropic isolates may be either R5X4 or X4 based on coreceptor use.\",\"Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus was first isolated in 1983, we have come to know it in exquisite detail. Yet we still do not understand sufficiently how it causes disease. Neither do we know why chimpanzees and some African monkeys, which are the natural reservoir of the precursors of HIV-1 and HIV-2, can harbour similar levels of virus without becoming ill. Our knowledge of the replication cycle of HIV as a retrovirus has been pivotal in the development of antiviral drugs. Our knowledge of the cellular tropism and cell surface receptors exploited by the virus help to explain the pattern of immune deficiency, wasting and dementia that make up the clinical dimensions of AIDS. The extraordinary rate of genetic and phenotypic evolution of the virus - both within the infected individual and across the worldwide pandemic - partially explains why no vaccine constructs to date have been successful. HIV comprises just 9 genes but represents one of humanity's most formidable foes.\",\"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses plasma viremia in most patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Prospective study of HIV-infected children (n=27) shows that, in 8 of 12 who responded to HAART (>/=0.5 log reduction in plasma HIV RNA), HAART restricted the number of coreceptors used by the predominant HIV isolate (mean number of coreceptors used at baseline was 4, vs. 1 coreceptor used at 6 months after treatment). This decrease was most striking in 6 of 8 children whose HIV coreceptor tropism changed from X4-tropic at baseline to R5-tropic. In 6 of 10 children tested, with plasma HIV RNA levels of <50 copies/mL, R5-tropic virus was isolated from CD4 T cell reservoirs. All the responding children had a significant increase in naive CD4 T cells (P<.05). These results show that persistent HIV T cell reservoirs are present in children and that HAART may influence the number and type of coreceptors used by the predominant virus isolate.\",\"The sequential association of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CD4 and a seven-transmembrane segment coreceptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4 initiates entry of the virus into its target cell. The N terminus of CCR5, which contains several sulfated tyrosines, plays a critical role in the CD4-dependent association of gp120 with CCR5 and in viral entry. Here we demonstrate that a tyrosine-sulfated peptide based on the N terminus of CCR5, but not its unsulfated analogue, inhibits infection of macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by CCR5-dependent, but not CXCR4-dependent, HIV-1 isolates. The sulfated peptide also inhibited the association of CCR5-expressing cells with gp120-soluble CD4 complexes and, less efficiently, with MIP-1alpha. Moreover, this peptide inhibited the precipitation of gp120 by 48d and 23e antibodies, which recognize CD4-inducible gp120 epitopes, but not by several other antibodies that recognize proximal epitopes. The ability of the sulfated peptide to block 48d association with gp120 was dependent in part on seven tropism-determining residues in the third variable (V3) and fourth conserved (C4) domains of gp120. These data underscore the important role of the N-terminal sulfate moieties of CCR5 in the entry of R5 HIV-1 isolates and localize a critical contact between gp120 and CCR5.\",\"The envelope (env) glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) determines several viral properties (e.g., coreceptor usage, cell tropism, and cytopathicity) and is a major target of antiviral immune responses. Most investigations on env have been conducted on subtype-B viral strains, prevalent in North America and Europe. Our study aimed to analyze env genes of subtype-E viral strains, prevalent in Asia and Africa, with a nonhuman primate model for lentivirus infection and AIDS. To this end, we constructed a simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV-1 subtype-E (SHIV) recombinant clone by replacing the env ectodomain of the SHIV-33 clone with the env ectodomain from the subtype-E strain HIV-1(CAR402), which was isolated from an individual in the Central African Republic. Virus from this recombinant clone, designated SHIV-E-CAR, replicated efficiently in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Accordingly, juvenile macaques were inoculated with cell-free SHIV-E-CAR by the intravenous or intravaginal route; virus replicated in these animals but did not produce hematological abnormalities. In an attempt to elicit the pathogenic potential of the recombinant clone, we serially passaged this viral clone via transfusion of blood and bone marrow through juvenile macaques to produce SHIV-E-P4 (fourth-passage virus). The serially passaged virus established productive infection and CD4(+) T-cell depletion in juvenile macaques inoculated by either the intravenous or the intravaginal route. Determination of the coreceptor usage of SHIV-E-CAR and serially passaged SHIV-E-P4 indicated that both of these viruses utilized CXCR4 as a coreceptor. In summary, the serially passaged SHIV subtype-E chimeric virus will be important for studies aimed at developing a nonhuman primate model for analyzing the functions of subtype-E env genes in viral transmission and pathogenesis and for vaccine challenge experiments with macaques immunized with HIV-1 env antigens.\",\"The pathogenic differences between CXCR4 (X4)- and CCR5 (R5)-utilizing strains of HIV-1 may be predominantly due to differences in viral tropism, which in turn may be due to differential coreceptor utilization. We tested this hypothesis in the human thymus organ of the SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse, using recombinants of NL4-3 that were isogenic except for Env coreceptor-binding determinants of the V1-V3 loops. Conversion of NL4-3 from an X4 to an R5 isolate was associated with altered tropism for cell subpopulations within the Thy/Liv organ (with a higher frequency of infection of thymic stromal cells, including macrophages), a slower rate of replication, and a lower level of cytopathicity. These observations underscore the causal relationships between tropism, coreceptor use, and cytopathicity in the human thymus in vivo.\",\"We examined the role of asparagine-linked glycosylation of the V2 loop of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) SF162 envelope on viral replication potential and neutralization susceptibility. We report that the asparagines located at the amino- and carboxy-terminal sites (at positions 154 and 195, respectively), as well as within the V2 loop of the SF162 envelope (at position 186), are glycosylated during in vitro replication of this virus in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our studies indicate that glycosylation of the V2 loop, in particular at its base, facilitates the interaction of the HIV envelope with the CD4 and CCR5 receptor molecules present on the surface of target cells and affects viral replication kinetics in a cell type-dependent manner. In cells expressing high numbers of receptor molecules on their surfaces, the SF162-derived V2 loop-deglycosylated mutant viruses replicate as efficiently as the parental SF162 virus, while in cells expressing small numbers of receptor molecules, the mutant viruses replicate with markedly reduced efficiency. In addition to expanding the viral tropism, V2 loop glycosylation at the three sites examined prevents neutralization by anti-CD4 binding site antibodies. In contrast, glycosylation at the amino- and carboxy-terminal sites of the V2 loop but not within the loop itself offers protection against anti-V3 loop antibodies. Thus, the epitopes masked by the sugar molecules present on the three glycosylation sites examined are not identical but overlap.\",\"In this study, coreceptor usage of HIV-1 other than subtype B in relation to HIV-1 transmission from mother to child was investigated. Repeated sampling of 42 HIV-1-seropositive, asymptomatic women in Cameroon during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, at delivery, and 6 months postpartum were performed. Env subtyping was carried out from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by heteroduplex mobility assay and, whenever necessary, by DNA sequencing. Virus isolates were tested for coreceptor usage on human cell lines-U87.CD4 and GHOST(3)-engineered to express stably CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, or the orphan receptors BOB/gpr15 or Bonzo/STRL33/TYMSTR. Transmission rate was 11.9%. Viruses were predominantly envelope subtype A and used CCR5 as coreceptor and, surprisingly, 4 of 28 (14.2%) isolates from mothers and 1 of 3 isolates from children used the orphan receptor Bonzo as well. In 2 transmitting mothers from whom sequential HIV-1 isolates were available, viral coreceptor usage evolved from CCR5 monotropic to CCR5/Bonzo dual tropic during pregnancy, and in 1 case transmission of this virus could be documented. Our data suggest that evolution of HIV-1 coreceptor usage to dual (or multi-) tropism may occur during pregnancy.\",\"The HIV-1 syncytium-inducing phenotype is determined by virus replication and the presence of cytopathic effects in MT-2 cells. There is a strong correlation between the syncytium-inducing/MT-2-tropic phenotype and positively charged amino acids at positions 306 and 320 in the V3 loop for HIV-1 subtypes A, B, D, and E. In contrast, a lack of correlation between signature amino acids and syncytium formation in MT-2 cells for subtype F viruses from Romania has been reported. Virus phenotype and V3 loop amino acid sequences from Romanian HIV-1 subtype F isolates were further investigated in the present study. While the determinants of MT-2 tropism are clearly harbored in the V3 loop of subtype F isolates from Romania, the induction of syncytium formation occurs in the presence or absence of positively charged amino acids at positions 306, 320, and/or 324. However, the net positive charge of V3 loop sequences derived from syncytium-inducing viruses was higher than that of the nonsyncytium-inducing isolate.\",\"Parenchymal microglia are targets of HIV infection. We, as well as others, have used in vitro microglia culture systems to study the tropism and replication of HIV. Characterization of perivascular and parenchymal microglia surface markers in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo, has led to the understanding that these cell populations are different, and data from both the HIV and SIV models support the hypothesis that they may play different roles in infection of the CNS. We determined that human adult parenchymal microglia cultured from temporal lobe tissue for use in HIV replication studies, were CD11c+, CD45+, CD68+, CD14- when cultured with standard serum/cytokine-supplemented media. To determine the influence of serum and cytokines on HIV replication in microglia, we designed a new protocol for culturing microglia, and compared the results obtained with this protocol with the standard approach previously described. Microglia cultured in the presence of a 'feeder' layer of glial cells and in the absence of serum and cytokines expressed the same surface markers as pure microglia (>95%) cultured in supplemented media. However, pure microglia cultured in the absence of both serum/cytokines supplements and other glial cells, did not have characteristic microglial morphology and did not support HIV replication to as high a level. Lastly, we determined that unlike monocytes, ex vivo parenchymal microglia were capable of supporting HIV replication.\",\"The increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infection worldwide calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model for evaluating strategies against the transmission of the virus. A chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), SHIV(CHN19), was generated with a primary, non-syncytium-inducing HIV-1 subtype C envelope from a Chinese strain in the background of SHIV(33). Unlike R5-tropic SHIV(162), SHIV(CHN19) was not found to replicate in rhesus CD4(+) T lymphocytes. SHIV(CHN19) does, however, replicate in CD4(+) T lymphocytes of pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The observed replication competence of SHIV(CHN19) requires the full tat/rev genes and partial gp41 region derived from SHIV(33). To evaluate in vivo infectivity, SHIV(CHN19) was intravenously inoculated, at first, into two pig-tailed and two rhesus macaques. Although all four animals became infected, the virus replicated preferentially in pig-tailed macaques with an earlier plasma viral peak and a faster seroconversion. To determine whether in vivo adaptation would enhance the infectivity of SHIV(CHN19), passages were carried out serially in three groups of two pig-tailed macaques each, via intravenous blood-bone marrow transfusion. The passages greatly enhanced the infectivity of the virus as shown by the increasingly elevated viral loads during acute infection in animals with each passage. Moreover, the doubling time of plasma virus during acute infection became much shorter in passage 4 (P4) animals (0.2 day) in comparison to P1 animals (1 to 2 days). P2 to P4 animals all became seropositive around 2 to 3 weeks postinoculation and had a decline in CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio during the early phase of infection. In P4 animals, a profound depletion of CD4 T cells in the lamina propria of the jejunum was observed. Persistent plasma viremia has been found in most of the infected animals with sustained viral loads ranging from 10(3) to 10(5) per ml up to 6 months postinfection. Serial passages did not change the viral phenotype as confirmed by the persistence of the R5 tropism of SHIV(CHN19) isolated from P4 animals. In addition, the infectivity of SHIV(CHN19) in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also increased after in vivo passages. Our data indicate that SHIV(CHN19) has adapted well to grow in macaque cells. This established R5-tropic SHIV(CHN19)/macaque model would be very useful for HIV-1 subtype C vaccine and pathogenesis studies.\",\"The aim of this study was to detect and determine the genetic variation of HIV-1 in Greece and to analyze the phylogenetic relationships and transmission dynamics of identified variants. Eighty-six blood samples from HIV-1 seroconverted patients of different risk groups were collected from the AIDS clinic, AHEPA Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece. Retroviral DNA was extracted from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV-1 DNA sequences encoding a 500-bp fragment of the gp120 C2-C3 region were amplified from each study subject, and they were genetically subtyped by heteroduplex mobility assay and DNA sequencing. Genetic distances and phylogenetic relationships of DNA sequences were estimated using PHYLIP software. Our results revealed that 82 out of 86 (95.3%) subjects carried subtype B sequences, while four (4.7%) carried subtype A sequences. Subtype A in Greek individuals not having traveled abroad was documented. An average of intrasubtype B genetic divergence of 15% was noted. Our findings demonstrate the presence of at least two genetic subtypes of HIV-1 in northern Greece--subtype B and subtype A. The predominant subtype is subtype B, which was transmitted into Greece by multiple sources. Our observations lend support to the argument that the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes is determined by founder effects or other processes rather than any tropism for particular cell types or mode of transmission.\",\"The present study sought to determine how usage of coreceptors by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 dictates cell tropism and depletion of CD4(+) T cells in human lymphoid tissues cultured ex vivo. We found that coreceptor preferences control the marked, preferential depletion of coreceptor-expressing CD4(+) lymphocytes. In addition, there was a strong, but not absolute, preference shown by CXCR4-using strains for lymphocytes and by CCR5-using strains for macrophages.\",\"The objective of this study was to identify phenotypic parameters that could distinguish among seemingly homogeneous non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) viruses and that might provide a surrogate marker for clinical progression in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We undertook a pilot analysis of 15 independent HIV-1 isolates collected prospectively from two mothers and their four children who displayed a spectrum of disease stages ranging from CDC categories A1 to C3. Viruses were evaluated for their ability to replicate in primary cells (including monocyte-derived macrophages [MDM]) and cell lines, for their co-receptor preference and for genetic features of the V3 hypervariable domain of env. Virtually all isolates displayed NSI phenotypes that were restricted in their capacity to replicate in cell lines and displayed V3 loops with uniformly low net positive charges. NSI viruses from two symptomatic children and one mother were macrophage-tropic, whereas NSI isolates from two asymptomatic children were unable to replicate in MDM and were designated primary lymphotropic viruses. Only one isolate was syncytium-inducing (SI), replicated in a variety of cell lines and in MDM, used multiple co-receptors, and was dual tropic, rather than a mixture of T-cell tropic and M-tropic viruses, as assessed by genetic analysis. Phenotypic heterogeneity among NSI viruses is revealed in the ability of isolates to replicate in MDM. This characteristic is related to disease stage and provides a potentially new in vitro criterion to distinguish among NSI isolates that is unlinked to other surrogate markers.\",\"We studied the immune profiles of 21 Japanese hemophiliac patients who had been infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by the blood preparations during the 1982-84 period, and carried out the genotyping of HIV-1 V3 region for uncultivated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 8 patients. Ten years after infection, asymptomatic carrier (AC, 14 cases) yet outnumbered those in AIDS related complex (ARC, 4 cases) and AIDS (3 cases), and the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers were not correlated with clinical stages. Macrophage tropic sequences, as identified according to the known tropism determinants, appeared to be more frequent as the CD4+ T-cell numbers were higher. There was no correlation of the cell tropism with the disease stages, however. It might be due to HIV-1 of CD4+ T-cells being more productive. The mutation in the V3 region appears to differentially influence the escape from antibody attack and clinical stages, and the cell tropism may not be related to the cell immunity of the host.\",\"We have previously shown that a number of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutants generated in vitro display a replication-defect in a cell-dependent manner. Of the mutants of this category, those of gag, vif, and env mutants do not grow at all in lymphocytic H9 (non-permissive) cells, but quite well in M8166 (permissive) cells. To determine whether the cell-dependent growth of the mutants is functionally related to each other, a number of double mutants were constructed, and monitored for their replication and biochemical property in various cells. The results obtained have indicated that there are multiple cellular factors responsible for the growth phenotype. Together with our previous findings on the host cell-dependent mutants of HIV-1, it is concluded that number of distinct cellular factors are involved in the various steps in HIV-1 replication cycle.\",\"A complex between the Tat protein, encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and the cellular protein, Puralpha, has been implicated in activation of the late promoter of JC virus (JCV) and in enhancement of JCV DNA replication. JCV is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) opportunistic infection of the brain. Puralpha also binds the HIV-1 TAR RNA element and activates HIV-1 transcription, suggesting a role for RNA binding in the action of this protein. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we find that in human glial cells expressing both proteins, Tat and Puralpha are colocalized in extranucleolar chromatin structural elements. The colocalized Puralpha and Tat are nearly exclusively nuclear, although individual proteins can be seen in both nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting a preferential tropism of the complex for the nucleus. Analysis of the interaction between purified proteins indicates that the Tat-Puralpha interaction is strongly enhanced by the presence of RNA. Tat amino acids from 37-48 are essential for Tat binding. Residues 49-72, including the TAR RNA-binding domain, are critical for binding to Puralpha, while Cys(22), in the Tat transactivation domain, is responsible for an important global effect. Puralpha repeat II domains are involved in the interaction, and a polypeptide based on one such sequence inhibits binding. After RNase treatment of Puralpha enhancement of Tat binding can be partially restored by addition of a single-stranded JCV DNA PUR element, to which Tat does not bind. The results indicate that the Tat-Puralpha interaction is direct, rather than through an RNA link, and that RNA binding configures Puralpha for optimal interaction with Tat.\",\"Retroviral vectors derived from amphotropic murine leukemia viruses (MLV) mediate gene transfer into almost all human cells and are thus not suitable for in vivo applications in gene therapy in which cell-specific gene delivery is required. We and others recently reported the generation of MLV-derived vectors pseudotyped by variants of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), thus displaying the CD4-dependent tropism of the parental lentivirus (Mammano et al., 1997, J. Virol. 71, 3341-3345; Schnierle et al., 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 8640-8645). However, because of their HIV-1-derived envelopes these vectors are neutralized by HIV-specific antibodies present in some infected patients. To circumvent this problem, we pseudotyped MLV capsid particles with variants of Env proteins derived from the apathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm) of African green monkeys (AGM; Chlorocebus pygerythrus). Truncation of the C-terminal domain of the transmembrane protein was found to be necessary to allow formation of infectious pseudotype vectors. These [MLV(SIVagm)] vectors efficiently transduced various human CD4-expressing cell lines using the coreceptors CCR5 and Bonzo to enter target cells. Moreover, they were resistant to neutralization by antibodies directed against HIV-1. Therefore, [MLV(SIVagm)] vectors will be useful to study the mechanisms of SIVagm cell entry and for the selective gene transfer into CD4+ T-cells of AIDS patients.\",\"Switch from non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) to syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with accelerated CD4(+) T cell depletion, which might partially be explained by higher virulence of SI variants compared with NSI variants. Because NSI and SI variants use different coreceptors for entry of target cells, altered tropism might offer an explanation for increased pathogenesis associated with SI HIV-1 infection. To investigate whether SI and NSI HIV-1 variants infect different CD4(+) T cell subsets in vivo, the distribution of SI and NSI variants over CD4(+) memory (CD45RA(-)RO(+)) and naive (CD45RA(+)RO(-)) cells was studied by using limiting dilution cultures. In contrast to NSI variants that were mainly present in CD45RO(+) cells, SI variants were equally distributed over CD45RO(+) and CD45RA(+) cells. Infection of memory cells by both NSI and SI HIV-1 and infection of naive cells primarily by SI HIV-1 corresponded closely with the differential cell surface expression of CXCR4 and CCR5. The frequency of SI-infected CD45RA(+) CD4(+) T cells, but not the frequency of NSI- or SI-infected CD45RO(+) CD4(+) T cells, correlated with the rate of CD4(+) T cell depletion. Infection of naive cells by SI HIV-1 may interfere with CD4(+) T cell production and thus account for rapid CD4(+) T cell depletion.\",\"Virions produced after HIV-1 infection of HTLV-I transformed cells have an expanded tropism that has been attributed to the presence of HTLV-I glycoproteins in the envelope. This report now directly identifies these phenotypically mixed virions by immunogold labelling electron microscopy. Furthermore we estimate there are 2% of these in cell-free supernatant, which represents up to 1 x 10(7) particles/ml from an in vitro infection. HTLV-1 envelope labelling was localised to a single region, suggesting a defined event in packaging of foreign envelope proteins into HIV-1 virus particles.\",\"The three amino acids glycine, proline, and glycine (GPG) constitute a conserved motif at the center of the V3 loop of HIV-1 surface glycoprotein 120. It has been indicated that deletion of this GPG motif is lethal for viral infectivity and abrogates the ability of the virus to form syncytia. In the present work, we studied the effects of GPG deletion on viral infectivity, cell tropism, syncytium formation, and initiation of apoptosis by constructing a mutant provirus based on the infectious clone pBRu-2. Successful infection and replication of GPG-deleted virus were detected in MT-2 cells, although the mutant virus showed lower infectivity. Infection could also be observed in the C8166, C91-PL, Molt-3, and THP-1 cell lines, and in PBMC-derived dendritic cells (DCs), but not in CEM-SS, HUT78, H9, Jurkat, and U937 cell lines or in PBMCs. Mutant virus also induced syncytia and apoptosis in the MT-2 cells. An intact GPG motif is probably necessary for unimpaired induction of fusion in some HIV-1-permissive cells. However, once the virus enters the cells, the GPG sequence does not seem to be indispensable for syncytium formation or apoptosis induction in MT-2 cells. Our data also imply that cell surface molecules other than CD4 and CXCR4 may be involved in entry of the GPG-deleted virus.\",\"In a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individual, immune-pressure-mediated positive selection operates to maintain the antigenic polymorphism on the gp120 third variable (V3) loop. Recently, we suggested on the basis of sequencing C2/V3 segments from an HIV-1 subtype E-infected family that a V3 sequence lineage group of the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants (group 1) was relatively resistant to positive selection pressure (35). To better understand the relationship between the intensity of positive selection pressure and cell tropism of the virus, we determined the linkage between each V3 genotype and its function of directing coreceptor preference and MT2 cell tropism. The biological characterization of a panel of V3 recombinant viruses showed that all of the group 1 V3 sequences could confer an NSI/CCR5-using (NSI/R5) phenotype on HIV-1(LAI), whereas the group 2 V3 sequence, which was more positively charged than the group 1 sequence, dictated mainly a syncytium-inducing, CXCR4-using (SI/X4) phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C2/V3 sequences encoding group 1 or 2 V3 suggested that the variants carrying group 1 V3 are the ancestors of the intrafamilial infection and persisted in the family, while the variants carrying group 2 V3 evolved convergently from the group 1 V3 variants during disease progression in the individuals. Finally, a statistical test showed that the V3 sequence that could dictate an NSI/R5 phenotype had a synonymous substitution rate significantly higher than the nonsynonymous substitution rate. These data suggest that V3 sequences of the subtype E NSI/R5 variants are more resistant to positive selection pressure than those of the SI/X4 variants.\",\"Microglia are the main reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the central nervous system (CNS), and multinucleated giant cells, the result of fusion of HIV-1-infected microglia and brain macrophages, are the neuropathologic hallmark of HIV dementia. One potential explanation for the formation of syncytia is viral adaptation for these CD4(+) CNS cells. HIV-1(BORI-15), a virus adapted to growth in microglia by sequential passage in vitro, mediates high levels of fusion and replicates more efficiently in microglia and monocyte-derived-macrophages than its unpassaged parent (J. M. Strizki, A. V. Albright, H. Sheng, M. O'Connor, L. Perrin, and F. Gonzalez-Scarano, J. Virol. 70:7654-7662, 1996). Since the interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein and CD4 and the chemokine receptor mediates fusion and plays a key role in tropism, we have analyzed the HIV-1(BORI-15) env as a fusogen and in recombinant and pseudotyped viruses. Its syncytium-forming phenotype is not the result of a switch in coreceptor use but rather of the HIV-1(BORI-15) envelope-mediated fusion of CD4(+)CCR5(+) cells with greater efficiency than that of its parental strain, either by itself or in the context of a recombinant virus. Genetic analysis indicated that the syncytium-forming phenotype was due to four discrete amino acid differences in V1/V2, with a single-amino-acid change between the parent and the adapted virus (E153G) responsible for the majority of the effect. Additionally, HIV-1(BORI-15) env-pseudotyped viruses were less sensitive to decreases in the levels of CD4 on transfected 293T cells, leading to the hypothesis that the differences in V1/V2 alter the interaction between this envelope and CD4 or CCR5, or both. In sum, the characterization of the envelope of HIV-1(BORI-15), a highly fusogenic glycoprotein with genetic determinants in V1/V2, may lead to a better understanding of the relationship between HIV replication and syncytium formation in the CNS and of the importance of this region of gp120 in the interaction with CD4 and CCR5.\",\"Several members of the chemokine receptor family are used as coreceptors together with CD4 for HIV and SIV entry in the central nervous system (CNS). CCR5 is the major coreceptor for HIV-1 infection of macrophages and microglia, the major target cells for HIV-1 infection in the CNS. CXCR4 and CCR3 are also expressed on microglia and can mediate infection by certain HIV-1 isolates but at lower efficiency than CCR5. Additional chemokine receptors that can function as HIV-1 and SIV coreceptors for a subset of viruses are expressed in the brain (i.e. Apj, CX3CR1, STRL33/BONZO, and gpr1), but their role in CNS infection has not been defined. The expression of CXCR4, and possibly other chemokine receptors, on subpopulations of neurons and glial cells may contribute to mechanisms of CNS injury that are independent of viral infection. Understanding the role of chemokine receptors and their chemokine ligands in HIV-1 and SIV infection of the CNS will elucidate mechanisms of viral tropism and pathogenesis and advance the development of new therapeutic strategies.\",\"In the central nervous system, HIV-1 has a defined tropism for brain macrophages and microglia. Nucleoside analog drugs such as zidovudine improve the clinical and neuropsychological functions in HIV-demented patients. Multiple carrier-mediated transport systems can play an important role in the membrane permeation of nucleosides and nucleoside analog drugs in a number of cells. The purpose of this project was to characterize the uptake properties of the pyrimidine nucleoside probe thymidine by a continuous rat microglia cell line (MLS-9) grown as a monolayer on an impermeable substratum. Approximately 50% of thymidine (10 microM) uptake by the monolayer cells was found to be Na(+) dependent. Kinetics of specific thymidine uptake showed a single saturation system (K(m) = 44 microM at 37 degrees C) and a Na(+)/thymidine stoichiometry of 2:1. Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside probes (50 microM) exerted a competitive inhibitory effect on specific thymidine uptake with K(i) values of 40, 38, 45, and 39 microM for adenosine, uridine, guanosine, and cytidine, respectively. In addition, nucleoside analog drugs significantly decreased specific thymidine uptake, with IC(50) values of 135.1 microM for abacavir and 0.6 microM for zidovudine, which inhibited in a noncompetitive manner. These results suggest that a Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system is present in rat microglia and that long-range interactions between antiretroviral nucleoside analog drugs and the nucleoside substrates may occur at the transporter sites.\",\"Viral phenotype, tropism, coreceptor usage, and envelope gene diversity were examined in blood isolates collected from 27 individuals at different stages of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease and tissue derived isolates from 10 individuals with AIDS. The majority (89%) of blood and all tissue HIV-1 isolates from all stages of infection were non-syncytium inducing and macrophage (M) tropic. Tropism and productive infection by HIV isolates in both monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) increased in advanced disease (HIV tropism for monocytes, 1 of 6 from categories I and II versus 11 of 21 [P = 0.05] from category IV and II [CD4 < 250]; and high-level replication in MDM, 1 of 6 from categories I and II versus 16 of 21 from categories IV and II [P = 0. 015]). There was a high level of replication of blood and tissue isolates in T lymphocytes without restriction at any stage. Overall, the level of replication in MDM was 5- to 10-fold greater than in monocytes, with restriction in the latter occurring mainly at entry and later stages of replication. Only three blood isolates were identified as syncytium inducing, and all had a dualtropic phenotype. There was a significant increase of HIV envelope gene diversity, as shown by a heteroduplex mobility assay, in advanced disease; this may partly underlie the increase of HIV replication in MDM. Unlike blood isolates (even those from patients with advanced disease), tissue isolates displayed greater similarities (90%) in productive infection between MDM and monocytes. The majority (87%) of all isolates, including those from patients with advanced disease, used CCR5, and only 5 of 37 isolates showed expanded coreceptor usage. These results indicate that in the late stage of disease with increasing viral load and diversity, CCR5 utilization and M-tropism persist in blood and tissue and the replicative ability in macrophages increases. This suggests that these characteristics are advantageous to HIV and are important to disease progression.\",\"HIV-1 LAI is a syncytium-inducing (SI) virus with a broad host cell range. We previously isolated a LAI variant that improved replication in the SupT1 T cell line due to mutations within the C1 and C4 constant regions of the Env protein. We now report that this variant exhibits a severely restricted host cell range, as replication in other T cell lines and primary cells was abolished. Several Env-mediated functions were analyzed to provide a mechanistic explanation for this selective adaptation. The change in host cell tropism was not caused by a switch to a SupT1-specific coreceptor. Biosynthesis of the variant Env glycoprotein was not improved in SupT1 cells, and in fact a small defect in intracellular Env processing was observed. SupT1 infection assays did not reveal an improved Env function either, and a dramatic loss of infectivity was measured with other cell types. The Env-mutated HIV-1 reached an approximately fivefold higher level of virus production in SupT1 cells at the peak of infection. Unlike the LAI virus, the variant did not trigger the formation of syncytia. Our combined results suggest that the HIV-1 variant allows the infected host cell to survive longer, thus producing more viral progeny. The intricate virus-cell interaction results in a balance between optimal virus replication and host cell survival, causing a cytopathic SI isolate to evolve toward a nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype in cell culture. These findings may help explain the absence of SI variants in the initial phase of HIV-1 infection, and the results dispute the notion that HIV-1 evolution should always go from the NSI to SI phenotype.\",\"Expression of chemokine receptors and beta-chemokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were determined in HIV-1-infected individuals before and after highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and their relationship to viral load, T cell phenotype and the expression of immunological activation markers was examined. We found that the expression of CCR5 is up-regulated in HIV-1-infected individuals while CXCR4 appears down-regulated on both CD4 and CD8 T cells compared with normal controls. These alterations are associated with the high levels of viral load. In addition, a relationship was observed between the degree of immune activation and chemokine receptor expression on T cells. However, after 3 months of combined anti-retroviral regimen, expression of CXCR4 significantly increased while CCR5 decreased when compared with pretherapy determinations. This was seen in strict association with a dramatic decrease of viral load and an increase of both CD45RA+/CD62L+ (naive) and CD45RA-/CD62L+ or CD45RA+/CD62L- (memory) T cells accompanied by a significant decrease of the expression of immune activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD38. At enrolment, both spontaneous and lectin-induced RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and MIP-1beta production by PBMC were higher in HIV-1-infected individuals compared with normal controls, although differences for MIP-1beta were not statistically significant. However, RANTES and MIP-1alpha production decreased during HAART at levels closer to that determined with normal controls, while MIP-1beta production was less consistently modified. These data indicate that the expression of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and the production of beta-chemokines are altered in HIV-infected individuals, and suggest that their early modifications during HAART reflect both the peripheral redistribution of naive/memory T cell compartments and the decrease in levels of T cell activation. Such modifications in the expression of host determinants of viral tropism and the production of anti-viral molecules may play a role in the emergence of virus variants when a failure of HAART occurs.\",\"HIV-1 cell tropism is determined initially at the level of fusion mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Cell-cell fusion assays are employed widely to study Env-mediated fusion, and generally require transfection of target cells with a reporter plasmid that is activated upon fusion with Env-expressing effector cells. Macrophages are an important target for HIV-1, but fusion studies using primary macrophages are limited by their resistance to transfection. An assay described previously used recombinant vaccinia virus to express T7 polymerase in macrophages, and effector cells transfected with a T7-driven reporter plasmid and infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing Env. However, this requires a recombinant vaccinia virus for each Env. We developed a method to study fusion using primary macrophages and HIV-1 env plasmid clones under control of the T7 promoter. Macrophages were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the SP6 RNA polymerase. Effector 293T cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase, and co-transfected with T7-driven env plasmids and an SP6-driven reporter gene plasmid. Cell-cell fusion mediated by T7-driven Env results in SP6-driven reporter gene transactivation. This approach is suitable for rapid analysis of multiple primary isolate, chimeric, or mutant env genes cloned into plasmid vectors.\",\"Russian HIV variants with common (rapid/high SI and slow/low NSI) and rare (slow/low SI and rapid/high NSI) phenotypes are described. SI variants demonstrate a higher p24 concentration level than serotype-independent NSI. The majority of SI variants belonging to A, B, and C serotypes were isolated from patients with mainly stage B3. At stages B2 and C2, when the majority of viruses are characterized by NSI phenotype, serotype D isolates are characterized only by SI phenotype. The spectrum of cell tropism was wide for all rapid/high strains and narrow for all slow/low ones.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of CD4(+) lymphocytes and macrophages involves interaction of the surface subunit of the envelope protein (gp120) with coreceptors. Isolates have been found with specific tropism for macrophages and/or T-cell lines, through the utilization of chemokine receptor CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4). The third hypervariable loop (V3 loop) of gp120 is the major determinant of tropism. Using chimeric envelopes between HXB2 (X4) and ADA (R5), we found that the C-terminal half of the V3 loop was sufficient to confer on HXB2 the ability to infect CCR5-expressing cells. A sequence motif was identified at positions 289 to 292 allowing 30% of wild-type levels of infection, whereas full activity was achieved with the conversion of Lys to Glu at position 287 in addition to the above motif. Moreover, V3 loops from either SF2 (X4R5) or SF162 (R5) also allowed infection of CCR5-expressing cells, supporting the importance of V3 loops in influencing CCR5 utilization. The effects of amino acid changes at position 287 on the level of infection via CCR5 showed that negatively charged residues (Glu and Asp) were optimal for efficient interaction whereas only bulky hydrophobic residues drastically reduced infection. In addition, sequences at the N terminus of the V3 loop independently modulated the level of infection via CCR5. This study also examined the susceptibility of chimeric envelopes to neutralization by anticoreceptor antibodies and suggested the presence of differential interaction between the chimeric envelopes and CCR5. These findings highlight the critical residues in the V3 loop that mediate HIV-1 infection.\",\"Qualitative and quantitative virological parameters were investigated in 68 long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) HIV-1-infected patients and 9 slow-progressor controls. LTNP status was defined as an asymptomatic HIV infection for at least 8 years, a stability of CD4+ cell counts > or =600 cells/mm3 and no antiretroviral therapy. LTNP subjects exhibited a lower median plasma RNA load than controls (6,000 vs. 40,000 RNA copies/ ml) despite a wide range of values in both groups. When compared to the control group, LTNP subjects also exhibited a lower virus isolation rate (65% vs. 100%) and cell-associated viremia (0.75 vs. 56.8 number of infectious unit/ million cells) when CD8-depleted CD4+ cells were tested. By contrast, no major differences in virus replication properties or cell tropism were observed. After 1 year of follow-up, no major overall changes in the virological parameters was observed in the 50 LTNP subjects evaluated at this time. However, nine patients had started antiretroviral therapy, and six others had increased viral loads. Despite the progression observed during the first year of follow-up, the hypothesis that there is a specific subgroup of LTNP patients who will not develop disease cannot be ruled out as yet.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) strains predominantly use the chemokine receptor CCR5, while syncytium-inducing (SI) strains use CXCR4. In vitro, SI isolates infect and replicate in a range of CD4(+) CXCR4(+) T-cell lines, whereas NSI isolates usually do not. Here we describe three NSI strains that are able to infect two CD4(+) T-cell lines, Molt4 and SupT1. For one strain, a variant of JRCSF selected in vitro, replication on Molt4 was previously shown to be conferred by a single amino-acid change in the V1 loop (M.T. Boyd et al., J. Virol. 67:3649-3652, 1993). On CD4(+) cell lines expressing different coreceptors, these strains use CCR5 predominantly and do not replicate in CCR5-negative peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from individuals homozygous for Delta32 CCR5. Furthermore, infection of Molt4 and SupT1 by each of these three strains is potently inhibited by ligands for CCR5, including 2D7, a monoclonal antibody specific for CCR5. CCR5 mRNA was present in both Molt4 and SupT1 by reverse transcription-PCR, although CCR5 protein could not be detected either on the cell surface or in intracellular vesicles. The expanded tropism of the three strains shown here is therefore not due to adaptation to a new coreceptor but due to the capacity to exploit extremely low levels of CCR5 on Molt4 and SupT1 cells. This novel tropism observed for a subset of primary HIV-1 isolates may represent an extended tropism to new CD4(+) cell types in vivo.\",\"Cell surface receptors exploited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) for infection are major determinants of tropism. HIV-1 usually requires two receptors to infect cells. Gp120 on HIV-1 virions binds CD4 on the cell surface, triggering conformational rearrangements that create or expose a binding site for a seven-transmembrane (7TM) coreceptor. Although HIV-2 and SIV strains also use CD4, several laboratory-adapted HIV-2 strains infect cells without CD4, via an interaction with the coreceptor CXCR4. Moreover, the envelope glycoproteins of SIV of macaques (SIV(MAC)) can bind to and initiate infection of CD4(-) cells via CCR5. Here, we show that most primary HIV-2 isolates can infect either CCR5(+) or CXCR4(+) cells without CD4. The efficiency of CD4-independent infection by HIV-2 was comparable to that of SIV, but markedly higher than that of HIV-1. CD4-independent HIV-2 strains that could use both CCR5 and CXCR4 to infect CD4(+) cells were only able to use one of these receptors in the absence of CD4. Our observations therefore indicate (i) that HIV-2 and SIV envelope glycoproteins form a distinct conformation that enables contact with a 7TM receptor without CD4, and (ii) the use of CD4 enables a wider range of 7TM receptors to be exploited for infection and may assist adaptation or switching to new coreceptors in vivo. Primary CD4(-) fetal astrocyte cultures expressed CXCR4 and supported replication by the T-cell-line-adapted ROD/B strain. Productive infection by primary X4 strains was only triggered upon treatment of virus with soluble CD4. Thus, many primary HIV-2 strains infect CCR5(+) or CXCR4(+) cell lines without CD4 in vitro. CD4(-) cells that express these coreceptors in vivo, however, may still resist HIV-2 entry due to insufficient coreceptor concentration on the cell surface to trigger fusion or their expression in a conformation nonfunctional as a coreceptor. Our study, however, emphasizes that primary HIV-2 strains carry the potential to infect CD4(-) cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 in vivo.\",\"Dual-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains infect both primary macrophages and transformed T-cell lines. Prototype T-cell line-tropic (T-tropic) strains use CXCR4 as their principal entry coreceptor (X4 strains), while macrophagetropic (M-tropic) strains use CCR5 (R5 strains). Prototype dual tropic strains use both coreceptors (R5X4 strains). Recently, CXCR4 expressed on macrophages was found to support infection by certain HIV-1 isolates, including the dual-tropic R5X4 strain 89.6, but not by T-tropic X4 prototypes like 3B. To better understand the cellular basis for dual tropism, we analyzed the macrophage coreceptors used for Env-mediated cell-cell fusion as well as infection by several dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Like 89.6, the R5X4 strain DH12 fused with and infected both wild-type and CCR5-negative macrophages. The CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100 blocked DH12 fusion and infection in macrophages that lacked CCR5 but not in wild-type macrophages. This finding indicates two independent entry pathways in macrophages for DH12, CCR5 and CXCR4. Three primary isolates that use CXCR4 but not CCR5 (tybe, UG021, and UG024) replicated efficiently in macrophages regardless of whether CCR5 was present, and AMD3100 blocking of CXCR4 prevented infection in both CCR5 negative and wild-type macrophages. Fusion mediated by UG021 and UG024 Envs in both wild-type and CCR5-deficient macrophages was also blocked by AMD3100. Therefore, these isolates use CXCR4 exclusively for entry into macrophages. These results confirm that macrophage CXCR4 can be used for fusion and infection by primary HIV-1 isolates and indicate that CXCR4 may be the sole macrophage coreceptor for some strains. Thus, dual tropism can result from two distinct mechanisms: utilization of both CCR5 and CXCR4 on macrophages and T-cell lines, respectively (dual-tropic R5X4), or the ability to efficiently utilize CXCR4 on both macrophages and T-cell lines (dual-tropic X4).\",\"Previously, we described the derivation of a pathogenic strain of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV(KU-2)) consisting of the tat, rev, vpu, and env genes of HIV-1 (strain HXB2) in a genetic background of SIV(mac)239 that causes AIDS and productive infection of the CNS in rhesus macaques (Macca mulatta) (Raghavan et al., 1997, Brain Pathol. 7, 851-861). We report here on the characterization of a molecular clone of SHIV(KU-2), designated SHIV(KU-2MC4), that caused CD4(+) T cell loss as well as neurological and renal disease in macaques. DNA sequence analysis of selected SIV regions of SHIV(KU-2MC4) revealed 10 nucleotide changes in the LTR, whereas Gag, Vif, Vpr, Vpx, and Nef had 1, 1, 1, 2, and 13 predicted amino acid substitutions, respectively, compared to SIV(mac)239. DNA sequence analysis of HIV-1 derived regions of SHIV(KU-2MC4) revealed 2, 1, 2, and 18 predicted amino acid substitutions in the Tat, Rev, Vpu, and Env proteins, respectively, when compared to SHIV-4. Unlike the parental SHIV-4, which is not tropic for macrophages, SHIV(KU-2MC4) replicated efficiently in macrophage cultures as determined by p27 assays. However, despite the numerous changes in the Env protein and newly acquired tropism for macrophages, SHIV(KU-2MC4), like the parental SHIV-4, used CXCR4 exclusively as its coreceptor for entry into susceptible cells. Inoculation of SHIV(KU-2MC4) into two rhesus macaques resulted in severe infection in which the numbers of circulating CD4(+) T cells in the blood declined rapidly by 2 weeks postinoculation and virus producing cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were identified throughout the course of infection. At the time of euthanasia (20 and 22 weeks), both macaques had lost a significant amount of weight and had no circulating CD4(+) T cells. In addition, one macaque developed intension tremors and uncoordinated movements. Virological examination of tissues at necropsy revealed active virus replication in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues such as the lung and brain. Histological examination revealed that the induced immunodeficiency was associated with lymphoid depletion of the lymph nodes and spleen, opportunistic infections, lentiviral encephalitis, and severe glomerulosclerosis of the kidney. This molecular clone will serve as the basis for analyzing the molecular determinants through which SHIV(KU-2) causes severe CD4(+) T cell loss, neurological disease, and SHIV nephropathy in rhesus macaques.\",\"SPC3, a synthetic multibranched peptide including the GPGRAF consensus motif of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 V3-loop is a potent inhibitor of HIV infection of human CD4+ lymphocytes, macrophages and CD4-/galactosylceramide+ human colon epithelial cells and is currently tested in phase II clinical trials (FDA protocol 257 A). The antiviral property of SPC3 was further investigated for its ability to inhibit LAV-2/B, an HIV-2 clone with a CD4-independent tropism. SPC3 inhibited the LAV-2/B-mediated infection of B-cell line which does not express the CD4 and the galactosylceramide molecules on their cell surface, suggesting an SPC3-sensitive CD4/galactosylceramide-independent pathway of viral infection in HIV susceptible cells. The molecular mechanism of the peptide inhibition was also investigated. The data suggested that the SPC3-mediated inhibition does not result from a direct competition between SPC3 and gp120 binding to the cell surface of the target cell.\",\"To investigate factors that affect mother-to-infant transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), autologous neutralizing antibody, viral load, and viral tropism were evaluated in 28 pregnant women infected with HIV-1, of whom 8 were transmitters and 20 nontransmitters. One (12%) of 8 transmitters versus 11 (55%) of 20 nontransmitters had autologous neutralizing antibody (P=.04). Plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA and infectious HIV-1 titers (mean+/-SD) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at delivery did not differ significantly between transmitters and nontransmitters (24, 266+/-10,101 vs. 31,589+/-9128 copies/mL and 29+/-12 vs. 42+/-17 infected cells per 106 PBMC, respectively). However, only transmitters (4 [50%] of 8) were HIV p24 antigen positive. The ability of HIV-1 strains to induce syncytium did not differ between groups (P=.6); however, only non-syncytium-inducing isolates were transmitted. Isolates from 4 (80%) of 5 transmitters versus 2 (18%) of 12 nontransmitters (P=.03) demonstrated increasing replication in macrophages. Thus, lack of autologous neutralizing antibody and increased replication in macrophages were significantly associated with mother-to-infant transmission. In addition, autologous neutralizing antibody was associated with reduced viral load.\",\"We examined the effect of amino acid substitutions of the GPGR (glycine-proline-glycine-arginine) tip sequence at the V3 domain of the Env protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) on its cell tropism and coreceptor use. We changed the GPGR sequence of a T-cell line (T)- and macrophage (M)-tropic (R5-R3-X4) HIV-1 strain, GUN-1wt, to GA(alanine)GR (the resulting mutant was designated GUN-1/A), GL(leucine)GR (GUN-1/L), GP(proline)GR (GUN-1/P), GR(arginine)GR (GUN-1/R), GS(serine)GR (GUN-1/S), or GT(threonine)GR (GUN-1/T). GUN-1/A, GUN-1/S, and GUN-1/T mutants infected brain-derived cells such as a CD4-transduced glioma cell line, U87/CD4, and a brain-derived primary cell strain, BT-20/N, as well as T-cell lines in a CD4-dependent manner, although the plating of these mutants onto macrophages was inhibited. GUN-1/L, GUN-1/P, and GUN-1/R mutants showed both T- and M-tropism, but did not plate onto the brain-derived cells. A CCR3, CCR5, CCR8, or CXCR4 gene was introduced into a CD4-positive glioma cell line, NP-2/CD4, which demonstrated complete resistance to various HIV-1 strains. Not only HIV-1 strains, which were infectious to macrophages, such as GUN-1wt, GUN-1v, GUN-1/L, and GUN-1/P, but also an HIV-1 strain, GUN-1v, which was hardly infectious to macrophages, grew well in NP-2/CD4 cells expressing CCR3 or CCR5. However, the M-tropic GUN-1/R mutant could not efficiently use CCR5 nor CCR3. No point mutants, except GUN-1/L, grew well in NP-2/CD4 cells expressing CCR8. These findings indicate that the cell tropism of HIV-1 to macrophages and brain-derived cells and their use of the coreceptors were markedly, though not always concomitantly, affected by the tip sequence of the V3 domain.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein (hTat) activates transcription initiated at the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter by a unique mechanism requiring recruitment of the human cyclin T1 (hCycT1) cofactor to the viral TAR RNA target element. While activation of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) gene expression by the EIAV Tat (eTat) protein appears similar in that the target element is a promoter proximal RNA, eTat shows little sequence homology to hTat, does not activate the HIV-1 LTR, and is not active in human cells that effectively support hTat function. To address whether eTat and hTat utilize similar or distinct mechanisms of action, we have cloned the equine homolog of hCycT1 (eCycT1) and examined whether it is required to mediate eTat function. Here, we report that expression of eCycT1 in human cells fully rescues eTat function and that eCycT1 and eTat form a protein complex that specifically binds to the EIAV, but not the HIV-1, TAR element. While hCycT1 is also shown to interact with eTat, the lack of eTat function in human cells is explained by the failure of the resultant protein complex to bind to EIAV TAR. Critical sequences in eCycT1 required to support eTat function are located very close to the amino terminus, i.e., distal to the HIV-1 Tat-TAR interaction motif previously identified in the hCycT1 protein. Together, these data provide a molecular explanation for the species tropism displayed by eTat and demonstrate that highly divergent lentiviral Tat proteins activate transcription from their cognate LTR promoters by essentially identical mechanisms.\",\"HIV-1 transmission and disease progression is, in general, characterized by initial predominance of macrophage tropic, non-syncytium-inducing strains followed by a switch to T-cell tropic, syncytium-inducing strains. Using sensitive, quantitative kinetic RT-PCR, we examined cytokine regulation of tropism-specific HIV-1 coreceptor expression in PBMCs from HIV-1-seronegative individuals. Proinflammatory (TNF-alpha and IL-12) and type 1 cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-2) significantly upregulated CCR5 (wt allele) mRNA expression in CCR5 homozygous wild-type (wt/wt) and heterozygous individuals (wt/del) (P < 0.02). CCR5 (wt) mRNA expression in unstimulated PBMCs was significantly increased in wt/wt individuals compared to that of wt/del individuals (P < 0.01). In wt/del individuals, del CCR5 mRNA was expressed at 10-fold greater levels than wt CCR5 mRNA in unstimulated PBMCs from the same individual. Flow cytometry confirmed that upregulated CCR5 mRNA following type 1 cytokine stimulation leads to increased cell surface expression of CCR5 protein. The type 2 cytokine IL-10 downregulated both CCR5 mRNA and protein expression in wt/wt and wt/del individuals. Proinflammatory, type 1, and type 2 cytokines significantly increased CXCR4 mRNA expression in wt/wt, wt/del, and del/del CCR5 genotypes (P < 0.02). These results suggest that changes in the cytokine milieu influence chemokine receptor expression and may explain emergence of tropism-specific strains facilitating HIV transmission and disease progression.\",\"To assess the role of naturally occurring basic amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype E on viral coreceptor usage and cell tropism, we have constructed a panel of chimeric viruses with mutant V3 loops of HIV-1 subtype E in the genetic background of HIV-1LAI. The arginine substitutions naturally occurring at positions 8, 11, and 18 of the V3 loop in an HIV-1 subtype E X4 strain were systematically introduced into that of an R5 strain to generate a series of V3 loop mutant chimera. These chimeric viruses were employed in virus infectivity assays using HOS-CD4 cells expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T-cell lines, or macrophages. The arginine substitution at position 11 of the V3 loop uniformly caused the loss of infectivity in HOS-CD4-CCR5 cells, indicating that position 11 is critical for utilization of CCR5. CXCR4 usage was conferred by a minimum of two arginine substitutions, regardless of combination, whereas arginine substitutions at position 8 and 11 were required for T-cell line tropism. Nonetheless, macrophage tropism was not conferred by the V3 loop of subtype E R5 strain per se. We found that the specific combinations of amino acid changes in HIV-1 subtype E env V3 loop are critical for determining viral coreceptor usage and cell tropism. However, the ability to infect HOS-CD4 cells through either CXCR4 or CCR5 is not necessarily correlated with T-cell or macrophage tropism, suggesting that cellular tropism is not dictated solely by viral coreceptor utilization.\",\"Proviral load as well as lymphocyte phenotype and function were compared in peripheral blood and lymph node compartments of 17 HIV-1, 12 HIV-2 and three dually infected patients with lymphadenopathy. The mean percentage (95% confidence interval (CI)) of CD4+ cells was higher in lymph node mononuclear cells (LNMC) than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in both infections, being 26.7% (21. 1%, 32.3%) and 15.3% (10.4%, 20.2%), respectively, for HIV-1-infected patients (P = 0.0001) and 32.3% (22.7%, 41.9%) and 22. 1% (13.6%, 30.6%), respectively, for HIV-2-infected patients (P = 0. 02). In both types of infection, proviral load adjusted for number of CD4+ cells was higher in LNMC than in PBMC: the geometric mean (95% CI) was 8937 (4991; 16 003) and 4384 (2260; 8503), respectively, for HIV-1 patients (P = 0.02) and 1624 (382; 6898) and 551 (147; 2058) DNA copies, respectively, for HIV-2 patients (P = 0.05). Proviral load in both compartments was closely correlated (HIV-1, r = 0.60, P = 0.01; and HIV-2, r = 0.83, P = 0.0003). In both infections, proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in response to purified protein derivative (PPD) was lower in LNMC than in PBMC, both of which, in turn, were lower than in healthy controls. These results indicate that in HIV-2 as in HIV-1 infection, infected cells have a tropism for the lymph nodes resulting in higher viral load in this compartment and lower lymphocyte responses to the recall antigen PPD which may increase susceptibility to tuberculosis.\",\"We describe combined analytic and experimental methods for determining reproductive statistics from time-series data. Our computational methods derive four fundamental measures from laboratory experiments: (i) average number of viral daughters; (ii) mean viral cycle time; (iii) standard deviation of the viral cycling time; and (iv) viral doubling time. Taken together, these four reproductive statistics characterize \\\"age-specific fertility,\\\" a quantity that provides complete information on the reproduction of the average viral particle. In this paper, we emphasize applications relating to HIV and experiments for assessing cellular tropism, viral phenotypes, antiviral drugs, humoral immunity, and cytotoxic cellular immunity. Nevertheless, our method is quite flexible and applicable to the evaluation of drugs against bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, antineoplastic agents against cancer cells, and perturbations involving pest and wildlife releases in ecosystems.\",\"In addition to CD4, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) requires a coreceptor for entry into target cells. The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5, members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, have been identified as the principal coreceptors for T cell line-tropic and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates, respectively. The updated coreceptor repertoire includes numerous members, mostly chemokine receptors and related orphans. These discoveries provide a new framework for understanding critical features of the basic biology of HIV-1, including the selective tropism of individual viral variants for different CD4+ target cells and the membrane fusion mechanism governing virus entry. The coreceptors also provide molecular perspectives on central puzzles of HIV-1 disease, including the selective transmission of macrophage-tropic variants, the appearance of T cell line-tropic variants in many infected persons during progression to AIDS, and differing susceptibilities of individuals to infection and disease progression. Genetic findings have yielded major insights into the in vivo roles of individual coreceptors and their ligands; of particular importance is the discovery of an inactivating mutation in the CCR5 gene which, in homozygous form, confers strong resistance to HIV-1 infection. Beyond providing new perspectives on fundamental aspects of HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis, the coreceptors suggest new avenues for developing novel therapeutic and preventative strategies to combat the AIDS epidemic.\",\"The biological characteristics of 11 HIV-1 strains isolated from patients with a fast clinical evolution to AIDS were studied. The viral isolates were classified according to their replication kinetics and cell tropism. Taking into account these criteria, it was observed that 8 of the isolated strains (72.7%) were of rapid high growth (RH) or slow low 3 (SL3) with preferential tropism to the lymphocytic stock, as it corresponds to AIDS patients. 3 (27.3%) had characteristics of slow low 1 (SL1). The cytopathogenicity of the strains was studied in the MT4 cellular line, and it was observed that most of them (72.7%) were syncytium-inducing strains (SI), which allowed to prove the in vivo and in vitro relation of the biological properties. It was not so in 3 of the cultures (27.3%) that behaved as non-syncytium inducers.\",\"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) display marked differences in their ability to replicate in macrophages and transformed T-cell lines in vitro, a property that has important implications for disease pathogenesis. The restriction in replication between these two CD4-positive cell types is largely at the level of viral entry and is regulated by the viral envelope (env) gene. The envelope protein (Env) is responsible for fusion of the viral and host membranes, and a particular region of Env called the V3-loop has been implicated in regulating viral tropism. However, other regions of Env, such as the V1- and V2-loops, have been shown to modulate the effects of the V3-loop. The discovery that Env initially binds the CD4 molecule on the target cell surface and then makes subsequent interactions with one of several members of the chemokine receptor family has greatly enhanced the molecular understanding of HIV-1 entry. The differential use of chemokine receptors by different viral isolates and their expression in different cell types largely explains viral tropism. The same regions in Env responsible for virus tropism have also been shown to play an important role in mediating chemokine receptor use. The recent crystallization of HIV-1 Env in complex with CD4 illuminates the architecture of the components involved in mediating fusion between the viral and host membranes. The spatial relationship between variable structures of Env previously implicated in tropism and chemokine receptor use and conserved Env structures potentially involved in chemokine receptor binding are discussed.\",\"HIV is a persistent virus that survives and replicates despite an onslaught by the host's immune system. A strategy for cell entry, requiring the use of two receptors, has evolved that may help evade neutralizing antibodies. HIV and SIV usually require both CD4 and a seven transmembrane (7TM) coreceptor for infection. At least eleven different 7TM coreceptors have been identified that confer HIV and/or SIV entry. For HIV-1, the major coreceptors are CCR5 and CXCR4, while the role of other coreceptors for replication and cell tropism in vivo is currently unclear. Polymorphisms in the CCR5 gene that reduce CCR5 expression levels, protect against disease progression, suggesting that drugs targeted to CCR5 could be effective. Such therapies however will not work if HIV simply adapts to use alternative coreceptors. In the light of these themes, this review will discuss the following topics: (i) the coreceptors used by primary HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses, (ii) the properties and coreceptors of HIV-2 strains that infect cells without CD4, (iii) the role of coreceptors in HIV cell tropism and particularly macrophage infection and (iv) the properties of chemokine receptor ligands that block HIV infection.\",\"The hypervariable V3 loop within gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the major determinant of cell tropism and the entry coreceptor usage of the virus. However, the information obtained thus far has been from only subtype B from North America and Europe, and little is known about other subtypes whose V3 amino acids differ by as much as 50% from subtype B V3. In this study, we examined the functional potential of the V3 element of the HIV-1 subtype E, the most crucial variant causing the AIDS epidemic throughout southeast Asia. A panel of HIV-1LAI recombinants was constructed by the overlap extension method, by which the LAI V3 loop was precisely replaced by that of the subtype E nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) or syncytium-inducing (SI) variant. All of the recombinant viruses infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas only those with SI V3 infected MT2 cells, a CD4(+) T cell line. Consistently, the SI V3 recombinants used CXCR4, while the NSI V3 recombinants used CCR5 for infection of HOS-CD4(+) cells. Finally, only the NSI V3 sequence conferred CC-chemokine sensitivity on the parental virus. The data support the notion that the HIV-1 V3 loop consists of a relatively independent domain in gp120 and suggest that the subtype E V3 loop indeed contains the functional element to dictate the cell tropism, coreceptor preference, and chemokine sensitivity of the virus. These findings are of immediate importance in understanding V3 structure-function relationship and for examining phenotypic evolution of HIV-1 subtype E.\",\"A better characterisation of mononuclear cell-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 is central to disease control as these viruses predominate in disease transmission. M-tropic viruses do not replicate in conventional T-cell lines, and virus titres obtained in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are low. Human T-lymphocytes which have been immortalised by Herpesvirus saimiri strain C488 (HVS T-cells) are highly permissive to the replication of T-cell tropic strains of HIV. This study aimed to determine if HVS T-cells support replication of M-tropic HIV isolates that have not been adapted to conventional T-cell lines. A panel of PBMC low passage/primary field isolates and their molecular clones was used. Results show that infection in HVS T-cells was longer lived than in PBMC. In terms of peak virus titre and duration of productive infection, the two HVS T-cell lines studied were superior to PBMC, and one supported enhanced replication of all M-tropic isolates. This is important for generating M-tropic virus pools of sufficient titre for further biological studies such as virus neutralisation, co receptor usage and testing of antivirals. Phenotypic analysis showed that HVS T-cells are CD4+-activated memory cells expressing both CXCR-4 and CCR5 co receptors. Thus, HVS immortalisation appears to select for the T-cell subset targeted by HIV-1 in vivo.\",\"Dementia is a common complication of AIDS which is associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of brain macrophages and microglia. Recent studies have shown that astrocytes are also infected in the brain but HIV-1 replication in these cells is restricted. To determine virus specificity of this restriction we tested the expression of 15 HIV-1 molecular clones in primary human fetal astrocytes by infection and DNA transfection. Infection with cell-free viruses was poorly productive and revealed no clone-specific differences. In contrast, transfected cells produced transiently high levels of HIV-1 p24 core antigen, up to 50 nanograms per ml culture supernatant, and nanogram levels of p24 were detected 3-4 weeks after transfection of some viral clones. The average peak expression of HIV-1 in astrocytes varied as a function of viral clone used by a factor of 15 but the differences and the subsequent virus spread did not correlate with the tropism of the viral clones to T cells or macrophages. Functional vif, vpu, and vpr genes were dispensable for virus replication from transfected DNA, but intact nef provided a detectable enhancement of early viral gene expression and promoted maintenance of HIV-1 infection. We conclude that primary astrocytes present no fundamental barriers to moderate expression of different strains of HIV-1 and that the presence of functional Nef is advantageous to virus infection in these cells.\",\"Twelve G protein-coupled receptors, including chemokine receptors, act as coreceptors and determinants for the cell tropisms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We isolated HIV-1 variants from T-cell-line (T)- and macrophage (M)-tropic (i.e., dualtropic) (R5-R3-X4) HIV-1 strains and also produced six HIV-1 mutants carrying single-point amino acid substitutions at the tip of the V3 region of the Env protein of HIV-1. These variants and three mutants infected brain-derived CD4-positive cells that are resistant to M-, T-, or dualtropic (R5, X4, or R5-X4) HIV-1 strains. However, a factor that determines this cell tropism has not been identified. This study shows that primary brain-derived fibroblast-like cell strains, BT-3 and BT-20/N, as well as a CD4-transduced glioma cell line, U87/CD4, which were susceptible to these HIV-1 variants and mutants and the HIV-2ROD strain, expressed mRNA of an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), GPR1. When a CD4-positive cell line which was strictly resistant to infection with diverse HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains was transduced with GPR1, the cell line became susceptible to these HIV-1 variants and mutants and to an HIV-2 strain but not to T- or dualtropic HIV-1 strains, and numerous syncytia formed after infection. These results indicate that GPR1 functions as a coreceptor for the HIV-1 variants and mutants and for the HIV-2ROD strain in vitro.\",\"CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor used by some strains of HIV-1 as an entry coreceptor in association with cell surface CD4 on human cells. In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals, the appearance of viral isolates with a tropism for CXCR4 (T tropic) has been correlated with late disease progression. The presumed natural ligands for CXCR4 are SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta, which are proposed to play a role in blocking T-tropic HIV-1 cell entry. Here, we demonstrate that addition of an N-terminal methionine residue to SDF-1beta (Met-SDF-1beta) results in a dramatically enhanced functional activity compared to that of native SDF-1beta. Equivalent concentrations of Met-SDF-1beta are markedly more inhibitory for T-tropic HIV-1 replication than SDF-1beta. A comparison of the biological activities of these two forms of SDF-1beta reveals that Met-SDF-1beta induces a more pronounced intracellular calcium flux yet binds with slightly lower affinity to CXCR4 than SDF-1beta. Down-modulation of CXCR4 is similar after exposure of cells to either chemokine form for 2 h. However, after a 48-h incubation, the surface expression of CXCR4 is much lower for cells treated with Met-SDF-1beta. The enhanced blocking of T-tropic HIV-1 by Met-SDF-1beta appears to be related to prolonged CXCR4 down-modulation.\",\"Strains of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) presently under investigation exhibit distinct patterns of in vitro tropism. In particular, the adaptation of FIV for propagation in Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells results in the selection of strains capable of forming syncytia with cell lines of diverse species origin. The infection of CrFK cells by CrFK-adapted strains appears to require the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and is inhibited by its natural ligand, stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha). Here we found that inhibitors of CXCR4-mediated infection by human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), such as the bicyclam AMD3100 and short peptides derived from the amino-terminal region of SDF-1alpha, also blocked infection of CrFK by FIV. Nevertheless, we observed differences in the ranking order of the peptides as inhibitors of FIV and HIV-1 and showed that such differences are related to the species origin of CXCR4 and not that of the viral envelope. These results suggest that, although the envelope glycoproteins of FIV and HIV-1 are substantially divergent, FIV and HIV-1 interact with CXCR4 in a highly similar manner. We have also addressed the role of CXCR4 in the life cycle of primary isolates of FIV. Various CXCR4 ligands inhibited infection of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by primary FIV isolates in a concentration-dependent manner. These ligands also blocked the viral transduction of feline PBMC by pseudotyped viral particles when infection was mediated by the envelope glycoprotein of a primary FIV isolate but not by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that they act at an envelope-mediated step and presumably at viral entry. These findings strongly suggest that primary and CrFK-adapted strains of FIV, despite disparate in vitro tropisms, share usage of CXCR4.\",\"A rapid decline in T-cell counts and the progression to AIDS is often associated with a switch from CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 to CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 or R5/X4 HIV-1 variants. Experimental infection with R5 HIV-1 causes less T-cell depletion than infection with X4 or R5/X4 variants in T-cell cultures, in ex vivo infected human lymphoid tissue and in SCID/hu mice, despite similar replication levels. Experimental genetic changes in those sequences in gp120 that transform R5 HIV-1 variants into otherwise isogenic X4 viruses make them highly cytopathic. Thus, it is now believed that R5 variants are less cytopathic for T cells than are X4 variants. However, it is not known why CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection does not lead to a massive CD4+ T-cell depletion, as occurs in CXCR4-mediated HIV-1 infection. Here we demonstrate that R5 HIV-1 isolates are indeed highly cytopathic, but only for CCR5+/CD4+ T cells. Because these cells constitute only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells, their depletion does not substantially change the total CD4+ T-cell count. These results may explain why the clinical stage of HIV disease correlates with viral tropism.\",\"The study of the immunological defects which arise from HIV infection has led to a deeper understanding both of the normal immune system and of the mechanisms by which it is damaged in disease. The interactions between viral and host factors during the early stages of HIV infection leads to a post-seroconversion steady state or 'set point' of viral RNA load, which has been shown to be a prognostic marker for subsequent progression rates, further underlining the important role of early immunological responses in the disease process. The changing immune response during the course of infection, together with the changing patterns of antigenicity and tropism leads to a complex series of evolutionary interactions which can be monitored as a series of changes in the properties of the virus over time. Furthermore, significant differences may be seen between the antigenicity of viruses adapted to grow in tissue culture and viruses cultured only briefly in primary cells, and also between the antigenicity of monomeric and oligomeric subunit immunogens. The immunodominant, highly polymorphic and rapidly changing envelope glycoproteins of HIV remains the single biggest target for the design of successful candidate vaccines. The recent crystallisation of one HIV envelope, the proven existence of functionally conserved neutralisation targets and our increasing knowledge of the behaviour of the envelope glycoprotein in vivo offers the possibility that the next generation of vaccine candidates will have a far higher chance of success than has currently been achieved.\",\"Non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants seem to be more readily transmitted than syncytium-inducing (SI) variants, and the switch from NSI to SI during HIV-1 infection seems to be a key determinant to the evolution of AIDS. We investigated eventual differences in the SI capacity on MT-2 cells according to genetic subtypes of HIV-1 and correlated this observations with CD4 counts and duration of HIV infection. In total, 86 patients, most with known date of HIV contamination and infected with different genetic subtypes, have been studied: 11 subtype A, 46 subtype B, 22 subtype C, and 7 subtype E. Multivariate analysis used a Cox's proportional hazards regression. The number and percentage of patients infected with an SI strain were as follows: 3 of 11 (27%) for subtype A, 15 of 46 (33%) for subtype B, 0 of 22 (0%) for subtype C, and 5 of 7 (71%) for subtype E. After adjustment for time after seroconversion and CD4 counts, significantly fewer SI variants were observed in patients infected with subtype C (p < .002) and it was found that subjects infected with subtype E had a higher risk of being infected with an SI strain (rate ratio [RR] = 12.39%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-98.67; p < .001). Most of the subtype E-infected patients from our study switched from an NSI to SI phenotype early after seroconversion (<4 years). To predict the in vitro presence of SI variants, we scanned V3-loop sequences for mutations at positions 11 and/or 25. Overall, 54 of 55 (98.2%) NSI strains in vitro were predicted NSI, and only 4 of 12 (33.3%) of SI viruses were predicted SI. For patients in whom a switch from an NSI to an SI virus was observed, the SI phenotype could be detected earlier in vitro than by the corresponding V3-loop sequence. No SI strains were observed among patients infected with subtype C; however, longer follow-up is needed to see whether the appearance of SI variants in subtype E or the absence of SI variants in subtype C-infected patients is also associated respectively with a faster or slower progression to AIDS as described for subtype B.\",\"The human chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 have emerged as the predominant cofactors, along with CD4, for cellular entry of HIV-1 in vivo whereas the contribution of other chemokine receptors to HIV disease has not been yet determined. CCR5-specific (R5) viruses predominate during primary HIV-1 infection whereas viruses with specificity for CXCR4 (R5/X4 or X4 viruses) often emerge in late stages of HIV disease. The evolution of X4 viruses is associated with a rapid decline in CD4+ T cells, although a causative relationship between viral tropism and CD4+ T cell depletion has not yet been proven. To rigorously test this relationship, we assessed CD4+ T cell depletion in suspensions of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in explants of human lymphoid tissue on exposure to paired viruses that are genetically identical (isogenic) except for select envelope determinants specifying reciprocal tropism for CXCR4 or CCR5. In both systems, X4 HIV-1 massively depleted CD4+ lymphocytes whereas matched R5 viruses depleted such cells only mildly despite comparable viral replication kinetics. These findings demonstrate that the coreceptor specificities of HIV-1 are a causal factor in CD4+ T cell depletion ex vivo and strongly support the hypothesis that the evolution of viral envelope leading to usage of CXCR4 in vivo accelerates loss of CD4+ T cells, causing immunodeficiency.\",\"We have shown that the binding of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to Jurkat T cells expressing CD4 receptor strongly induces mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and only weakly induces p38 MAP kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Similarly, T-tropic NL4-3 virus, which uses both CD4 and CXCR4 receptors for entry, stimulated in these cells the MEK/ERK MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway in a CD4 receptor-dependent manner (Popik and Pitha, 1998). In contrast, both macrophage-tropic SIVmac316 and T cell-tropic SIVmac239, which in addition to CD4 require CCR5 coreceptor for entry, significantly enhanced early MEK/ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK signaling in Jurkat cells expressing constitutively or transiently the CCR5 receptor. Together, this study provides the evidence that viruses using CXCR4 or CCR5 receptors for entry may differentially use signaling properties of their specific coreceptors to stimulate MAP kinase cascades. In addition, although SIVmac239 and SIVmac316 use different structural domains of the CCR5 receptor for entry, both viruses stimulate early phosphorylation of MEK, ERK, p38, and JNK independently of their tropism and replication.\",\"Biological membrane fusion is an important part of many cellular processes and is a critical step in the entry of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1, into cells. For HIV-1 to infect cells, the virus must bind to the cell surface, after which the viral Env protein must be triggered to undergo a conformational change that mediates membrane fusion. Cell-surface binding has long been known to occur via a high-affinity interaction between Env and CD4. However, the cell-surface molecules responsible for triggering the fusion-inducing conformational change in the Env protein have been only recently identified, permitting the study of HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion in much greater detail (for review, see 1). These molecules, termed coreceptors, have been shown to be members of the nine-transmembrane domain receptor family. The most important HIV-1 coreceptors are the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 (2-7), although at least nine other chemokine receptors or orphan receptors have been shown to support cellular entry for subsets of HIV-1 or SIV strains (3,5,8-11). The ability of a given virus strain to utilize particular chemokine receptors is a major determinant of cellular tropism. Thus, it is desirable to identify the receptors used by virus strains in a rapid, quantitative, and reproducible manner.\",\"CD4 was identified in 1984 as the receptor for HIV-1 (1,2). However, it was soon apparent that a second receptor was necessary for HIV-1 infection of CD4(+) cells. This coreceptor was first identified by Berger and colleagues who showed that fusion and entry of T-cell line-adapted strains of HIV-1 into CD4(+) cells were mediated by a member of the seven transmembrane chemokine receptor family (3). This protein was initially termed \\\"fusin\\\" and later found to be the \\u03b1-chemokine receptor CXCR4. Subsequent reports by several laboratories rapidly identified a \\u03b2-chemokine receptor, CCR5, that mediated entry of macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates into CD4(+) cells (4-8). Since these initial reports, our understanding of HIV-1 cell entry has continued to evolve. It now seems clear that primary HIV-1 strains with a nonsyncytium-inducing pheno-type (in MT2 cells) utilize the CCR5 coreceptor and are designated \\\"R5,\\\" whereas syncytium-inducing viruses preferentially utilize CXCR4, but may be dual tropic and are designated either \\\"X4\\\" or X4R5, respectively (9,10). Some viruses also appear to be able to utilize chemokine receptors CCR2B and CCR3 (7-10). In addition, the role of chemokine coreceptors in the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection and disease progression is just beginning to be understood. Individuals who are homozygous for a 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 gene are only rarely found to be HIV-1-infected, and the heterozygous CCR5/\\u0394ccr5 genotype has been associated with a survival advantage against HIV-1 disease progression (11-14).\",\"HIV-1 is routinely isolated by cocultivation of patient PBMC with mitogen-stimulated HIV-uninfected donor PBMC (see Chapter 1 ). In this culture system, HIV-1 primarily replicates in CD4(+) T-lymphocytes, and such viruses are termed clinical or primary isolates. As early as 1986, the in vitro replicative capacity and cell tropism of primary HIV-1 isolates were shown to be important in the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection (1). High replication capacity in PBMC and virus growth and syncytium formation in neoplastic T-cell lines were found to correlate with severity of HIV-1-disease (2-5). Compared to syncytium-inducing (SI) isolates, nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) strains did not replicate in neoplastic T-cell lines and showed preferential replication in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage (6,7). Thus, NSI viruses have often been termed macrophage tropic, whereas SI strains are termed T-cell line tropic.\",\"The tropism of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) determined by sequences other than env has been studied. The restriction of HIV-1 replication in monkey cells was demonstrated to be regulated by viral non-env sequence. Likewise, the gag-pol region of SIVagm (virus of the African green monkey) genome was found to be responsible for growth restriction in human cells of the virus. No viral DNA synthesis was detected in cells nonpermissive for the viruses. In addition, a number of HIV-1 gag gene mutants, which have an early defect in viral replication cycle and direct no viral DNA synthesis in some cells, exhibited a phenotype of host range mutant. Taken together, it can be concluded that the viral tropism associated with the uncoating/ reverse transcription process does exist in HIV/SIV replication. Furthermore, many of the accessory gene mutants of HIV/SIV exhibit host cell-dependent replication property. In this review, we summarize these examples of non-env tropism of HIV/SIV.\",\"A homozygous 24-bp deletion (Delta24) was found in the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) of 11 out of 15 red-capped mangabeys (RCMs), Cercocebus torquatus torquatus, both in Africa and in an American zoo. The CCR5 Delta24 defect encompassed eight amino acids in frame in the fourth transmembrane region. Unexpectedly, RCM-009, one of 11 homozygotes (Delta24CCR5/ Delta24CCR5), was found to be naturally infected with a divergent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strain, which was not R5-tropic, but used CCR2b (R2b) as its major coreceptor. SIVrcmGab1 was the only R2b-tropic SIV among other divergent SIVs tested. Cells transfected with the Delta24 CCR5 did not support entry of R5-tropic SIVmac, SIVcpz, SIVmne, HIV-2, or HIV-1, and were also inactive in signal transduction mediated by beta-chemokines. At 86.6%, the Delta24 allelic frequency was significantly higher than that of the 32-bp deletion found in humans. The Delta24 frequency was 4.1% in 34 sooty mangabeys (SMs), a geographically isolated subspecies that was naturally infected with R5-tropic SIV. Finding identical deletions in two mangabey subspecies separated for 10,000 years or more dates the Delta24 CCR5 deletion as ancient. However, the source of the selective pressure for the high rate of CCR5 deletion in RCMs remains to be determined. The high allelic frequency of the Delta24 CCR5 in RCMs, in comparison to that of SMs, suggests that R2b-tropism may have been acquired by SIVrcm, as an adaptation to CCR5 genetic defects appeared in its host.\",\"In healthy people, oral and pharyngeal epithelium preferentially carries Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) belonging to a genotype that possesses three copies of a 29 base-pair repeat in the first intron of the BZLF-1 gene, while peripheral blood mostly carries a genotype that bears two copies. Whether EBV shows differential tropism in HIV-1-coinfected hosts, who are prone to develop oral hairy leukoplakia, has not been studied. Tongue scrapings and CD45+-enriched peripheral blood cells of 20 HIV1-infected patients and 40 healthy controls were examined. EBV-specific DNA was amplified from segments in the first intron of the BZLF-1 gene, in exon C of the LMP-1 gene, and the type A/B-specifying domain of the EBNA-3C gene. Size polymorphisms of these amplicons were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequence differences among BZLF-1 gene amplicons by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The predominant EBV genotype in peripheral blood as well as tongue carried two copies of the BZLF-1 repeat. In controls, although the BZLF-1 genotype with two copies was exclusively detected in the blood, the genotype with three copies predominated in the tongue. The findings could not be correlated with EBV genotyped according size polymorphisms in the EBNA-3C or LMP-1 genes. DNA sequences of a proportion or all of the clones derived from the BZLF-1 amplicons in the tongues of HIV-1-infected patients were identical to those in the blood. These findings are consistent with EBV haematogenous superinfection of the tongue of HIV-positive individuals. Such superinfection may precede or lead to the development of oral hairy leukoplakia.\",\"CCR5-utilizing (R5) and CXCR4-utilizing (X4) strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been studied intensively in vitro, but the pathologic correlates of such differential tropism in vivo remain incompletely defined. In this study, X4 and R5 strains of HIV-1 were compared for tropism and pathogenesis in SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice, an in vivo model of human thymopoiesis. The X4 strain NL4-3 replicates quickly and extensively in thymocytes in the cortex and medulla, causing significant depletion. In contrast, the R5 strain Ba-L initially infects stromal cells including macrophages in the thymic medulla, without any obvious pathologic consequence. After a period of 3 to 4 weeks, Ba-L infection slowly spreads through the thymocyte populations, occasionally culminating in thymocyte depletion after week 6 of infection. During the entire time of infection, Ba-L did not mutate into variants capable of utilizing CXCR4. Therefore, X4 strains are highly cytopathic after infection of the human thymus. In contrast, infection with R5 strains of HIV-1 can result in a two-phase process in vivo, involving apparently nonpathogenic replication in medullary stromal cells followed by cytopathic replication in thymocytes.\",\"Human thymocytes are readily infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we found that the kinetics of replication and cytopathic effects of two molecular isolates, NL4-3 and JR-CSF, in postnatal thymocytes are best explained by the distribution of chemokine receptors used for viral entry. CXCR4 was expressed at high levels on most thymocytes, whereas CCR5 expression was restricted to only 0.1 to 2% of thymocytes. The difference in the amount of proviral DNA detected after infection of fresh thymocytes with NL4-3 or JR-CSF correlated with the levels of CXCR4 and CCR5 surface expression. Anti-CCR5 blocking studies showed that low levels of CCR5 were necessary and sufficient for JR-CSF entry in thymocytes. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-7, cytokines normally present in the thymus, influenced the expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 on thymocytes and thus increased the infectivity and spread of both NL4-3 and JR-CSF in culture. NL4-3 was produced by both immature and mature thymocytes, whereas JR-CSF production was restricted to the mature CD1(-)/CD69(+) population. Although CXCR4 and CCR5 distribution readily explained viral entry in mature CD69(+) and immature CD69(-) cells, and correlated with proviral DNA distribution, we found that viral production was favored in CD69(+) cells. Therefore, while expression of CD4 and appropriate coreceptors are essential determinants of viral entry, factors related to activation and stage-specific maturation contribute to HIV-1 replication in thymocyte subsets. These results have direct implications for HIV-1 pathogenesis in pediatric patients.\",\"Human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) use chemokine receptors as coreceptors along with CD4 to mediate viral entry. Several orphan receptors, including GPR1, GPR15, and STRL33, can also serve as coreceptors for a more limited number of HIV and SIV isolates. We investigated whether these orphan receptors could function as efficient coreceptors for a diverse group of HIV and SIV envelopes (Envs) in comparison with the principal coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. We found that a limited number of HIV-1 isolates could mediate inefficient cell-cell fusion with the orphan receptors relative to CCR5 and CXCR4; however, none of the orphan receptors tested could support pseudotype virus infection despite robust infection via CCR5 or CXCR4. All except one of the SIV Envs tested mediated some degree of cell-cell fusion and pseudotype infection, with target cells expressing at least one of these orphan receptors, although CCR5 proved to be the most efficient coreceptor for infection. Only one SIV Env protein, BK28, could mediate infection using GPR1 as a coreceptor, albeit much less efficiently than with CCR5. In addition, use of these coreceptors did not correlate with the published tropism of the SIV clones and was strictly CD4 dependent for both SIV and HIV. We also examined the expression of these molecules in cell lines and primary cells widely used for virus propagation and as targets for infection. All cells examined expressed STRL33, a more limited number expressed GPR15, and GPR1 was much more restricted in its expression pattern. Taken together, our results indicate that GPR15 and STRL33 are rarely used by HIV-1 but are more frequently used by SIV strains, although not in a manner that correlates with SIV tropism.\",\"CD8-positive T cells are thought to play an important role in the control of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of their cytotoxic activity and by releasing soluble factors. In AIDS patients, the absolute number of CD8+ T lymphocytes is decreased in peripheral blood and their turnover rate is increased, suggesting that there is more cell renewal and cell death occurring. Anti-retroviral therapy raises CD8+ T-cell counts in HIV-infected patients. Here we report that the death rate of CD8+ T cells by apoptosis increased markedly during HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. Apoptosis is induced in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant envelope glycoprotein gp120 from HIV strain X4, or by stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), the physiological ligand of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Apoptosis is mediated by the interaction between tumour-necrosis factor-alpha bound to the membrane of macrophages (mbTNF) and a receptor on CD8+ T cells (TNF-receptor II, or TNFRII). The expression of both of these cell-surface proteins is upregulated by HIV infection or by treatment with recombinant gp120 or SDF-1. Apoptosis of CD8+ T cells isolated from HIV-infected patients is also mediated by macrophages through the interaction between mbTNF and TNFRII. These results indicate that the increased turnover of CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected subjects is mediated by the HIV envelope protein through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor.\",\"Dramatic progress has been made recently in identifying both viral and cellular molecules responsible for binding and fusion of HIV-1 to target cells. In vivo, HIV-1 infection is transmitted by viruses that recognize chemokine receptor CCR5, while viruses isolated at later stages of HIV disease often recognize another chemokine receptor, CXCR4. It is still not understood how this molecular tropism of HIV-1 is translated into the virus' ability to compromise normal cell functions, which results in impairment of lymphoid tissue and causes AIDS. Here, we discuss how the new molecular findings might relate to HIV pathogenesis in cells and tissues.\",\"The envelope (Env) proteins of primate lentiviruses interact sequentially with CD4 and a coreceptor to infect cells. Changes in coreceptor use strongly influence viral tropism and pathogenesis. We followed the evolution of coreceptor use in pig-tailed macaques that developed severe CD4 T-cell loss during the derivation of a pathogenic simian HIV (SHIV) that contained the tat, rev, vpu, and env genes of the HXBc2 strain of HIV-1 in a genetic background of SIVmac239. The Env from the parental virus as well as one derived from the first macaque to develop AIDS exclusively used CXCR4 as a coreceptor, indicating that CXCR4 can function as a coreceptor in macaques even though it is rarely used by simian immunodeficiency viruses. One Env (Pnb5), obtained from a macrophage-tropic virus isolated from the cerebral spinal fluid, did not use CCR5 or CXCR4. Instead, it used CCR2b and to a lesser extent CCR3, STRL33, and APJ to infect cells. Chimeras between Pnb5 and the parental X4 Env indicated that the V3 loop is the major determinant of CXCR4 use, with other regions of Env influencing the efficiency with which this coreceptor was used. In contrast, the Pnb5 V1/2 and V3 regions in combination were both necessary and sufficient to confer full use of CCR2b, CCR3, STRL33, and APJ to the parental X4 Env protein. These results are consistent with a single, conserved binding site in Env that interacts with multiple coreceptors in conjunction with the V1/2 and V3 loops, and suggest that the V1/2 region plays a more important role in governing the use of CCR2b, CCR3, STRL33, and APJ than for CXCR4.\",\"The identification of HIV-1 coreceptors has provided a molecular basis for the tropism of different HIV-1 strains. CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) mediates the entry of both primary and T cell line-adapted (TCLA) syncytia-inducing strains. Although macrophages (M phi) express CXCR4, this coreceptor is assumed to be nonfunctional for HIV-1 infection. We addressed this apparent paradox by infecting human monocyte-derived M phi with primary and TCLA isolates that were rigorously characterized for coreceptor usage and by adding the natural CXCR4 ligand, stem cell differentiation factor-1, to specifically block CXCR4-mediated entry. Our results show that primary HIV-1 isolates that selectively use CXCR4 productively infected both normal and C-C chemokine receptor-5-null M phi. By contrast, M phi supported the entry of CXCR4-dependent TCLA strains with variable efficiency but were not productively infected. Thus, the tropism of HIV isolates results from complex virus/host cell interactions both at the entry and postentry levels.\",\"The chemokine receptor CCR5 plays a key role in the CD4-dependent entry of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses into target cells. We have mapped the interaction sites on CCR5 for a number of novel anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies and have used these to study the role of the CCR5 N-terminal ectodomain in viral entry and to demonstrate differential CCR5 epitope expression on different cell types. Deletions of the CCR5 amino terminal domain or substitution with equivalent regions from other chemokine receptors did not affect cell surface expression or reactivity with loop-specific antibodies, suggesting that the loop regions remained conformationally intact. Exchanges of the amino terminal segment of CCR5 with the equivalent domains of CCR1, CCR2, and CXCR4 did not significantly affect infection with virus pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins (Envs) from HIV-2 and SIV, but substitution with the CXCR4 sequence abrogated entry mediated by Env from HIV-1. In contrast, deletion of the amino terminus abrogated CCR5 receptor activity for all viral Envs examined. These data indicate that the amino terminus of CCR5 has an essential role in entry mediated by diverse viral Envs but that the sequence requirements are more relaxed for the HIV-2 and SIV Envs compared to the HIV-1 Env examined. This suggests that different viral Envs make distinct and specific interactions with the amino terminus of CCR5. Viral Env utilization of CCR5 expressed on 293-T cells does not always correlate with the cellular tropism of the virus, and one possible explanation is that Env-accessible interaction sites on CCR5 differ on different cell types. We therefore analyzed binding of several anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to cell lines and primary cells that express this chemokine receptor and found that whereas all antibodies bound to CCR5-transfected 293T cells, several did not bind to PBMC. The results suggest that CCR5 undergoes cell type specific structural modifications which may affect interaction with different HIV and SIV envelope glycoproteins.\",\"HIV-1 has been subdivided into two groups, M and O, based on phylogenetic analysis. To better understand the pathogenesis of group O viruses, we studied biologic and genetic characteristics of two primary isolates from Spain, ES1158.1 and ES1159.1, and one from the United States, MD.1. After viral isolation, we studied the replication kinetics in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages, as well as in different cell lines. All three isolates could replicate in both PBMCs and macrophages. Because no syncytium formation was detected in the MT-2 cell line, viruses were classified as non-syncytium inducing (NSI). All three isolates used the CCR5 coreceptor for entry into the human osteosarcoma (HOS) CD4 cells. Phylogenetic analysis of V3 loop sequences showed that ES1158.1 and ES1159.1 isolates were closely related to the ANT70 strain, whereas MD.1 isolate clustered with the MVP-5180 strain in the same branch. Interestingly, all viruses appeared to be more closely related to the MVP-5180 strain when the protease gene was analyzed, although accessible sequences of this region are very limited.\",\"To elucidate genetic characteristics of HIV-1 subtype E involved in vertical transmission, V3 regions of HIV-1 subtype E isolated from 17 infected mothers (M1-M17) and their infants (I1-I17) at 1 month after birth were sequenced after cloned into pCRII vectors. At least three clones of each sample were collected. All mothers were asymptomatic and had been infected through a heterosexual route. Nine infants (I9-I17) showed mild symptomatic and immunosuppression within the first year of life. The interpatient nucleotide distance of mothers and infants in this group (0.065+/-0.008) were of greater diversity than those of a nonimmunosuppression group (0.039+/-0.006) by a significant amount (Fischer's exact test, p = .003). The substitution with asparagine (N) at threonine (T) at position 13 and aspartic acid (D) at position 29 of the V3 sequence were significantly associated with nonimmunosuppression in the first year of life (F-test, p = 0.003). Either a single or multiple viral variants could transmit from mothers to their infants.\",\"Biological characteristics of 26 HIV strains circulating in the Republic of Belarus were studied in cell cultures. By the replicative activity, infectivity, and tropism to certain cell lines, all the strains can be divided into 2 groups: rapid/high and slow/low. Slow/low HIV strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients with lymphadenopathy and from AIDS patients. On the other hand, two rapid/high strains were isolated from patients without clinical signs of AIDS 6-8 months after probable infection.\",\"The differential use of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) may be intimately involved in the transmission and progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Changes in coreceptor utilization have also been noted upon adaptation of primary isolates (PI) to growth in established T-cell lines. All of the T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) viruses studied to date utilize CXCR4 but not CCR5. This observation had been suggested as an explanation for the sensitivity of TCLA, but not PI, viruses to neutralization by recombinant gp120 antisera and V3-directed monoclonal antibodies, but recent studies have shown coreceptor utilization to be independent of neutralization sensitivity. Here we describe a newly isolated TCLA virus that is sensitive to neutralization but continues to utilize both CXCR4 and CCR5 for infection. This finding further divorces coreceptor specificity from neutralization sensitivity and from certain changes in cell tropism. That the TCLA virus can continue to utilize CCR5 despite the changes that occur upon adaptation and in the apparent absence of CCR5 expression in the FDA/H9 T-cell line suggests that the interaction between envelope protein and coreceptor may be mediated by multiple weak interactions along a diffuse surface.\",\"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are used by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in conjunction with CD4 to infect cells. In addition, some virus strains can use alternative chemokine receptors, including CCR2b and CCR3, for infection. A polymorphism in CCR2 (CCR2-V64I) is associated with a 2- to 4-year delay in the progression to AIDS. To investigate the mechanism of this protective effect, we studied the expression of CCR2b and CCR2b-V64I, their chemokine and HIV-1 coreceptor activities, and their effects on the expression and receptor activities of the major HIV-1 coreceptors. CCR2b and CCR2b-V64I were expressed at similar levels, and neither molecule affected the expression or coreceptor activity of CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4 in cotransfected cell lines. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CCR2-V64I heterozygotes had normal levels of CCR2b and CCR5 but slightly reduced levels of CXCR4. CCR2b and CCR2b-V64I functioned equally well as HIV-1 coreceptors, and CCR2-V64I PBMCs were permissive for HIV-1 infection regardless of viral tropism. The MCP-1-induced calcium mobilization mediated by CCR2b signaling was unaffected by the polymorphism, but MCP-1 signaling mediated by either CCR2b- or CCR2-V64I-encoded receptors resulted in heterologous desensitization (i.e., limiting the signal response of other receptors) of both CCR5 and CXCR4. The heterologous desensitization of CCR5 and CXCR4 signaling by both CCR2 allele receptor types provides a mechanistic link that might help explain the in vivo effects of CCR2 gene variants on progression to AIDS as well as the reported antiviral activity of natural CCR2 ligands.\",\"For several years, the cellular basis behind the differences in HIV-1 tropism and the species specificity of HIV-1 has remained unclear. Since the discovery that chemokine receptors are essential cofactors for entry of HIV-1 into cells, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of the role played by co-receptors in HIV-1 biological variability, HIV-1 transmission and AIDS pathogenesis.\",\"Although inactivation of enveloped viruses transmitted by plasma derivatives has been successful, no methods for virus inactivation or removal have been established for platelet concentrates or red cell (RBC) components. Relatively little is known regarding the extent or significance of virus interactions with the cellular constituents in these components. Units of whole blood were collected from six HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-positive, asymptomatic individuals and separated into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs), cell-free plasma, white cell-reduced platelet concentrate, and white cell-reduced RBCs. DNA and RNA polymerase chain reaction and virus culture methods were used to study the compartmentalization of HIV-1 immediately after component preparation and after storage. As expected, HIV DNA and infectious virus were detected in fresh blood and in PBMNCs, and virion-associated RNA was detected in fresh plasma from all six donors. The levels of viral nucleic acids in these preparations remained relatively stable with 4 degrees C storage, whereas infectivity of PBMNCs was rapidly lost. Washed RBCs tested negative for HIV in all assays at all time points. Platelets retained high levels of HIV RNA (but not infectivity) after extensive washing, as well as after storage at 4 and 22 degrees C. High-level platelet-associated HIV-1 was also demonstrated in samples collected during early seroconversion. Periseroconversion and postseroconversion levels of platelet-associated HIV-1 correlated with the level of plasma viremia and with the rate of progression to AIDS. Cell-free virus from donor plasma and tissue culture fluid rapidly and firmly attached to platelets from noninfected donors. Infectivity of tissue culture virus bound to platelets was demonstrated in vitro. Significant levels of HIV-1 are associated with platelets during all stages of infection. Platelet-associated HIV could either mediate virus clearance or facilitate virus dissemination and expanded tropism. Finally, virus inactivation research must address virus associations with platelets.\",\"Genetically divergent strains of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from macaques (mac), chimpanzees, and sooty mangabeys (SM) efficiently used rhesus and human CCR5 (R5), but not CXCR4 (xR4), for cell entry. Thus far, however, no studies have characterized primary SIVsm strains for their use of coreceptors derived from their own natural host. Coreceptor usage of two primary, blood-derived SIVsm isolates, SIVsmSL92b and SIVsmFNS from naturally infected sooty mangabeys, was determined. Primary SIVsm efficiently used SM-CCR5 expressed on HOS.CD4 and U87.CD4 cells. Sequence polymorphisms in CCR5 found in four sooty mangabeys did not alter viral entry. Unlike primary rhesus blood-derived R5-tropic SIVmac251, primary SM blood-derived R5-tropic SIVsm was strongly CD4 dependent. The SM-CXCR4 gene was fully functional for xR4-tropic primate lentiviruses, but was not used by primary SIVsm. Therefore, the lack of xR4 tropism among naturally occurring SIVsm strains was not due to CxCR4 gene defects in the natural host. SIVmac derived from four macaques with AIDS also did not use macaque- or SM-derived CXCR4, showing that xR4 tropism did not develop during progression to disease as for humans infected with HIV-1. Three of four primary HIV-2 strains used CCR5 from human, sooty mangabey, and macaque. The fourth, HIV-27924A, obtained from a patient with AIDS, was xR4-tropic. Because SIVmac is most closely related to HIV-2, SIVmac might be expected to rnimic tropisms of HIV-2 infections. However, the correlation between xR4 tropism and AIDS may be a species-specific phenomenon limited to humans. The R5-tropic primary SIVsm and HIV-2 strains grew in CCR5-negative human PBMC, consistent with their use of non-CCR5 coreceptors. However, primary SIVsmSL92b did not use non-CCR5 coreceptors efficiently. The two primary SIVsm isolates replicated poorly in CEMx174 cells, which do not express CCR5, compared to CCR5-positive PM1 cells. SIVmac grew equally well in both cell lines. The findings show that SM-chemokine receptors are fully functional for virus entry and that multicoreceptor tropism is a common property of primary lentiviruses within the SIVsm/HIV-2 subfamily.\",\"Several members of the chemokine receptor are used as coreceptors for HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system (CNS). CCR5 and CCR3 are coreceptors together with CD4 for HIV-1 infection of microglia, the major target for HIV-1 infection in the CNS. Microglia express CXCR4, but their infection by HIV-1 viruses that use only CXCR4 as a coreceptor is relatively inefficient. CXCR4 is also expressed in subpopulations of neurons that are resistant to HIV-1 infection. Additional orphan chemokine receptors that can mediate HIV-1 or SIV entry are expressed in the brain or neurally-derived cell lines, but their role in CNS infection has not been defined. The pattern of chemokine receptor expression in the brain is likely to determine the tropism of HIV-1 for particular CNS target cells and to impact inflammatory and degenerative mechanisms associated with CNS infection.\",\"Although infection by primary HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates normally requires the functional interaction of the viral envelope protein with both CD4 and the CCR-5 coreceptor, a subset of such isolates also are able to use the distinct CCR-3 receptor. By analyzing the ability of a series of wild-type and chimeric HIV-1 envelope proteins to mediate CCR-3-dependent infection, we have determined that CCR-3 tropism maps to the V1 and V2 variable region of envelope. Although substitution of the V1/V2 region of a CCR-3 tropic envelope into the context of a CCR-5 tropic envelope is both necessary and sufficient to confer CCR-3 tropism, this same substitution has no phenotypic effect when inserted into a CXCR-4 tropic HIV-1 envelope context. However, this latter chimera acquires both CCR-3 and CCR-5 tropism when a CCR-5 tropic V3 loop sequence also is introduced. These data demonstrate that the V1/2 region of envelope can, like the V3 loop region, encode a particular coreceptor requirement and suggest that a functional envelope:CCR-3 interaction may depend on the cooperative interaction of CCR-3 with both the V1/V2 and the V3 region of envelope.\",\"To construct an infectious chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV-1 (SHIV) with the envelope of a Thai subtype E HIV-1 strain for use in a non-human primate model. A novel SHIV genome was derived using the sequences of the ectodomain of the envelope gene from the Thai subtype E strain, HIV-1(9466). This SHIV (SHIV9466.33) was recovered by cocultivation from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after transfection of human rhabdosarcoma cells. Rhesus macaque and baboon PBMC were screened in vitro for susceptibility to infection with SHIV9466.33. After successful infection of baboon PBMC, four animals were inoculated intravenously with SHIV9466.33 and monitored for plasma viral RNA, virus isolation from the PBMC, seroconversion, T-cell subsets, and signs of disease. SHIV9466.33 was able to infect PBMC from 12 out of 14 baboons. All four of the baboons selected for in vivo inoculation became infected. Peak plasma viral RNA levels of 8000 to 700,000 RNA copies/ml were measured at 2 weeks post-inoculation. Virus was isolated from the PBMC of all four baboons during acute infection, and all seroconverted. Although transient declines in CD4+ T-cells were observed during early infection, CD4+ levels remained within normal ranges thereafter. In contrast, in vitro cultures of PBMC of four rhesus macaques were not susceptible to infection with SHIV9466.33. SHIV9466.33 containing an HIV-1 subtype E envelope displayed tropism for baboon PBMC but not for rhesus macaque PBMC. This chimeric virus established infection and induced antiviral antibodies in baboons inoculated by the intravenous route with cell-free virus. Thus, infection of baboons with SHIV9466.33 will serve as an important animal model for future studies of HIV-1 vaccine efficacy.\",\"The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with CD4 and one of a cadre of chemokine receptors triggers conformational changes in the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein that lead to membrane fusion. The coreceptor activity of the second extracellular loop of CXCR4, which is restricted to dual tropic and T-tropic strains, was insensitive to the removal of charged residues either singly or in combinations by alanine scanning mutagenesis or to the conversion of acidic residues to lysine. Conversion of Asp-187 to a neutral residue exclusively unmasked activity with M-tropic Env in fusion and infection experiments. Insertion of the D187V mutation into chimeras containing extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4 in a CXCR2 framework also resulted in the acquisition of M-tropic coreceptor activity. The independence of CXCR4 coreceptor activity from charged residues and the extension of its repertoire by removing Asp-187 suggest that this interaction is not electrostatic and that coreceptors have the potential to be utilized by a spectrum of Env, which may be masked by charged amino acids in extracellular domains. These findings indicate that the primary structural determinants of coreceptors that program reactivity with M-, dual, and T-tropic Env are surprisingly subtle and that relatively insignificant changes in CXCR4 can dramatically alter utilization by Env of varying tropism.\",\"The beta-chemokine receptor CCR-5 is the coreceptor for cellular entry by non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) HIV-1 strains that dominate early in infection. A 32 base-pair deletion (delta32) in the CCR-5 gene renders this coreceptor non-functional. Heterozygosity for this deletion [delta32/wild-type (wt)] is associated with slow disease progression. The purpose of this study was to document the combined impact on HIV-1 disease progression of the CCR-5 genotype and the biological phenotype of HIV-1. In a cross-sectional study of 258 HIV-1-infected Swedish individuals, the CCR-5 genotype (wt/wt or delta32/wt) was determined by polymerase chain reaction and the biological phenotype [NSI or syncytium-inducing (SI)] of virus isolates was determined in the MT-2 cell assay. Clinical status, HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma, CD4+ lymphocyte counts, and rate of CD4+ lymphocyte decline, based on retrospective analysis of CD4+ lymphocyte counts, were also recorded. None of the individuals were treated with protease inhibitors. The prevalence of the delta32/wt genotype was 23%. Subjects with the delta32/wt CCR-5 genotype more often carried SI virus than subjects with the wt/wt genotype (49 versus 35%; P=0.067), but there were no differences between the two groups in prevalence of AIDS, viral load, CD4+ lymphocyte count or CD4+ slope. NSI virus isolates were found in 159 (62%) out of 258 individuals. Individuals with NSI had lower prevalence of AIDS (39 versus 19%; P < 0.01), higher CD4+ lymphocyte counts (289+/-188 x 10(6)/l versus 153+/-162 x 10(6)/l; P=0.001), lower viral loads (median, 4.45 log10 versus 4.91 log10 copies/ml; P < 0.01) and a lower prevalence of the delta32/wt genotype (19 versus 29%; P=0.067) compared with individuals with SI virus. When the material was further subdivided, subjects with the delta32/wt genotype and SI virus had the highest prevalence of AIDS (P < 0.001), lowest CD4+ lymphocyte count (P=0.0001) and highest viral load (P=0.023) whereas the opposite was true for subjects with the delta32/wt genotype and NSI virus. A significantly higher proportion of subjects with NSI virus with delta32/wt and wt/wt CCR-5 genotype had been immunized with recombinant gp160. In summary, the delta32/wt CCR-5 genotype has a protective effect against HIV-1 disease progression that appears to be limited to individuals carrying HIV-1 variants with NSI phenotype. Immunization with recombinant gp160 tended to reduce the frequency of SI phenotypes.\",\"Multiple viral subpopulations coexist in an HIV infected patient with dynamics of selection established between them. In order to get insight on the phenotype of these subpoblations, and its relation with disease progression, we have studied the biological variability of HIV-1 in 113 patients. Variability was related with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, clinical status, way of viral transmission and antiretroviral treatment. 113 patients (80 adults and 33 children) were studied for HIV-1 isolation in cocultures of infected and non infected lymphocytes. Viral replication was evaluated as rapid (R)/slow (S) or high (H)/low (L). Syncytia formation was estimated in MT2 cell line (SI/NSI). The tropism toward lymphocytes and monocytes (LM) was studied on H9 and U937 cell lines. Up to 86.7% of viral isolates were R, 56.6% were H and 49.6% were SI. These percentages increased with disease progression. Eight viral strains were R/H/NSI cocultivated in MT2 cells and SI in cocultured lymphocytes (NSI/SI), which may be considered as a new phenotype. All the SI isolates and all the R/H (SI and NSI) isolates were LM. Three categories were established: R/H/SI/LM, R/H/NSI/LM and S/L/NSI/NLM. The first two categories corresponded to patients with CD4+ T lymphocytes <200 x 10(6)/I (56%, 50%). The third category corresponded to patients with > 500 x 10(6)/I (53.3%). Viral replication and SI phenotype, independently, are useful markers for severity of HIV infection. The biological differences among NSI of the 3 viral phenotype categories, including the new subgroup NSI/SI, may indicate the existence of more pathogenic NSI subpopulations.\",\"Simian immunodeficiency virus isolated from African green monkeys (SIVagm) does not grow in many of human cell lines such as CEM x 174, H9, and MT-4, but could replicate in some human cell lines. Sequence of SIVagm responsible for its narrow host range was determined by making and monitoring growth potential of chimeric clones between SIVagm and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The results obtained indicated that the gag-pol region determines the observed narrow host range. By monitoring virus DNA synthesis and progeny virion production, the defect(s) of SIVagm in the replication in the restricted cells was demonstrated to be located at early phase.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has tropism for helper T lymphocytes and cells of the monocyte/ macrophage lineages. HIV-1 can also infect other cell types, including B cells. We show here that 10% of fresh circulating B cells from HIV-1-seronegative donors (i) express the CD4 receptor and CCR5 and CXCR4, two recently described coreceptors for HIV-1 and (ii) are permissive to HIV-1 with de novo proviral DNA integration following ex vivo infection by either SI (syncytium-inducing) or NSI (non-syncytium-inducing) isolates. To get further information on the interaction between HIV and B cells, the susceptibility of several EBV-positive or -negative B cell lines to infection by SI and NSI isolates was checked. Following infection of an EBV- CD4+ CXCR4+ CCR5- B cell line (DG75) by an SI HIV-1 isolate, we obtained a cell line which chronically produced low-level infectious HIV-1 for 2 years (HIV-DG75). Immunocytochemical data, combined with in situ PCR data, established that HIV-DG75 cells consist of at least three populations uninfected cells, infected virus-producing cells, and infected but nonproducing cells. Moreover, HIV-DG75 cells which express p24 antigen do not go into apoptosis, contrary to T lymphocytes. We infer from these results that B cells could constitute a reservoir of infectious virus in infected patients.\",\"The gp120-derived V3 loop of HIV-1 is involved in co-receptor interaction, it guides cell tropism, and contains an epitope for antibody neutralization. Thus, HIV-1 V3 is an attractive vaccine candidate. The V3 of the MN strain (MN V3) contains both B- and T-cell epitopes, including a known mouse H-2d-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope. In an attempt to improve the immunogenicity of V3 in DNA vaccines, a plasmid expressing MN V3 as a fusion protein with the highly immunogenic middle (pre-S2 + S) surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) was constructed. Epidermal inoculation by gene gun was used for genetic immunization in a mouse model. Antibody and CTL responses to MN V3 and HBsAg were measured and compared with the immune responses obtained after vaccination with plasmids encoding the complete HIV-1 MN gp160 and HBsAg (pre-S2 + S), respectively. DNA vaccination with the HIV MN gp160 envelope plasmid induced a slow and low titred anti-MN V3 antibody response at 12 weeks post-inoculation (p.i.) and a late appearing (7 weeks), weak and variable CTL response. In contrast, DNA vaccination with the HBsAg-encoding plasmid induced a rapid and high titred anti-HBsAg antibody response and a uniform strong anti-HBs CTL response already 1 week p.i. in all mice. DNA vaccination with the chimeric MN V3/HBsAg plasmid elicited humoral responses against both viruses within 3-6 weeks which peaked at 6-12 weeks and remained stable for at least 25 weeks. In addition, specific CTL responses were induced in all mice against both MN V3 and HBsAg already within the first 3 weeks, lasting at least 11 weeks. Thus, HBsAg acts as a 'genetic vaccine adjuvant' augmenting and accelerating the cellular and humoral immune response against the inserted MN V3 loop. Such chimeric HIV-HBsAg plasmid constructs may be useful in DNA immunizations as a 'carrier' of protein regions or minimal epitopes which are less exposed or poorly immunogenic.\",\"Substantial effort is being directed toward generating vaccines that can prevent the heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. If \\\"selection\\\" for specific variants during sexual intercourse occurs, then vaccines should be designed to prevent transmission of these specific viruses. Using the SIV-rhesus macaque model to test the hypothesis that specific HIV genotypes are more efficient at producing infection by sexual transmission, it was possible to demonstrate that the genotypic determinants that permit SIV or SHIV to produce systemic infection differ depending on the route of virus inoculation. This finding supports the conclusion that there is selection for viral genotypes during sexual transmission of HIV. However, the ability of a virus to grow in rhesus macaque monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro does not predict the outcome of intravaginal inoculation with that virus. We did find that after intravenous inoculation all the vaginally transmitting viruses produced plasma antigenemia and high levels of plasma viral RNA. In contrast, although the nontransmitting viruses infect rhesus macaques after intravenous inoculation, the infection that occurs after intravenous inoculation is characterized by a lack of viral antigen in plasma and low levels of plasma viral RNA. On the basis of these results, it is clear that viruses which are adapted to replicate to high levels in vivo are transmitted by vaginal inoculation. This principle may also apply to the transmission of HIV in humans.\",\"Children affected with human immunodefficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) usually develop significant renal glomerular and tubular epithelial cell injury. The pathogenesis of these changes is not clearly understood. Human renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEc) do not express CD4 surface receptors, and it is not clear whether these cells can be infected by HIV-1. Certain strains of HIV-1, however, have been shown capable of infecting CD4-negative epithelial cell lines. We hypothesized that the inability of laboratory strains of HIV-1 to infect renal epithelial cells may be due to a limited tropism, as opposed to wild-type viruses derived from children with HIVAN, and that viruses derived from these children are capable of infecting RTEc from the same patient. Here, we have demonstrated that HIV-1 isolates from children with HIVAN can productively infect RTEc through a CD4 independent pathway, and that infected mononuclear cells can transfer the virus to human RTEc. Human RTEc sustained low levels of viral replication and HIV-1 inhibited the growth and survival of cultured human RTEc. Thus, HIV-1 may directly induce degenerative changes in RTEc of children with HIVAN. Infected macrophages may play a relevant role in this process by transferring viruses to RTEc.\",\"Two distinct infectious molecular clones of human immunodeficiency type 2 (HIV-2) were analyzed for their biological properties in six cell lines. Fourteen chimeric and ten mutant viruses were constructed from these two viral genomes to localize the genetic determinants responsible for the phenotypes. Growth property of the viruses in the cell lines, together with the biochemical data, showed that a major determinant for the viral tropism resides in the env gene. In addition, in some cell lines, the accessory genes vif and nef affected the efficiency of virus replication. Thus, like HIV-1, mutations in the auxiliary and env genes of HIV-2 contributed much to the differences in virological characteristics.\",\"To investigate the transferability of macrophage (Mphi)-tropism among primate lentiviruses, we constructed recombinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus strain mac (SIVmac) and chimeric HIV-1/SIVmac (SHIV) having env region Mphi-tropic determinants. A recombinant HIV-1 having env partially derived from a Mphi-tropic HIV-1 strain (JR-FL) replicated in human macrophages but not in monkey macrophages. Conversely, a recombinant SIVmac having env from a Mphi-tropic strain (SIVmac316) replicated in monkey macrophages but not in human macrophages. A new SHIV (designated NM-3rN/JRFL) carrying the LTR and gag, pol, vif, vpx and nef of SIVmac and vpr, tat, rev, vpu and env of HIV-1 with env partially replaced by that of JR-FL was replication-competent in human macrophages but not in monkey macrophages. These results suggest that the Mphi-tropic determinant is specific to each host species and that the mechanism of Mphi-tropism is different between HIV and SIV.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain 89.6 is a dualtropic isolate that replicates in macrophages and transformed T cells, and its envelope mediates CD4-dependent fusion and entry with CCR5, CXCR-4, and CCR3. To map determinants of cofactor utilization by 89.6 and determine the relationship between cofactor use and tropism, we analyzed recombinants generated between 89.6 and T-cell-tropic (HXB) or macrophage-tropic (JRFL) strains. These chimeras showed that regions of 89.6 env outside V3 through V5 determine CXCR-4 utilization and T-cell line tropism as well as CCR5 utilization and macrophage tropism. However, the 89.6 env V3 domain also conferred on HXB the ability to use CCR5 for fusion and entry but not the ability to establish productive macrophage infection. CCR3 use was conferred on HXB by 89.6 env V3 or V3 through V5 sequences. While replacement of the 89.6 V3 through V5 region with HXB sequences abrogated CCR3 utilization, replacement of V3 or V4 through V5 separately did not. Thus, CCR3 use is determined by sequences within V3 through V5 and most likely can be conferred by either the V3 or the V4 through V5 domains. These results indicate that cofactor utilization and tropism in this dualtropic isolate are determined by complex interactions among multiple env segments, that distinct regions of the Env glycoprotein may be important for utilization of different chemokine receptors, and that determinants in addition to cofactor usage participate in postentry stages in the virus replication cycle that contribute to target cell tropism.\",\"Qualitative differences among strains of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) may influence viral infectivity for cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and determine or at least significantly influence the neuropathogenesis of brain infection. In this study, we compared infectivity for these cells in vitro among several different laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains differing in cellular tropism. These strains included three lymphotropic strains (SF2, NL4-3, and SG3.1), two macrophage-tropic strains (SF128A, SF162), and one brain-derived strain (YU2). In microglia, macrophage-tropic strain SF128A established productive infection while the lymphotropic strain SF2 did not. In infected astrocytes, all HIV-1 strains transiently produced variable and much lower levels of p24 antigen. Viral DNA env or tat gene sequences were amplified from infected astrocytes; the amplified signals varied among HIV-1 strains, but the strongest viral DNA signals were obtained from cells infected by the lymphotropic strains SF2 and SG3.1. Transfection of astrocytes with infectious HIV-1 proviral DNA clones confirmed the observation that HIV-1 strains differ in their ability to replicate in astrocytes. Transfection revealed post-entry blocks to replication by macrophage-tropic proviruses pSF128A and pSF162. However, cytomegalovirus (CMV) superinfection of transfected astrocytes enhanced p24 production by lymphotropic HIV-1 proviruses twofold and stimulated p24 production by the otherwise inactive macrophage-tropic proviruses. This study demonstrates the spectrum of HIV-1 strain-associated variation in infectivity for neuroglia, and suggests, in addition, that herpesviral factors or viral-induced cellular factors may stimulate HIV-1 infection in astrocytes and expand the neural cell tropism of certain HIV-1 strains.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in mononuclear phagocyte lineage cells (monocytes, macrophages, and microglia) is a critical component in the pathogenesis of viral infection. Viral replication in macrophages serves as a reservoir, a site of dissemination, and an instigator for neurological sequelae during HIV-1 disease. Recent studies demonstrated that chemokine receptors are necessary coreceptors for HIV-1 entry which determine viral tropism for different cell types. To investigate the relative contribution of the beta-chemokine receptors CCR3 and CCR5 to viral infection of mononuclear phagocytes we utilized a panel of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains (from blood and brain tissue) to infect highly purified populations of monocytes and microglia. Antibodies to CD4 (OKT4A) abrogated HIV-1 infection. The beta chemokines and antibodies to CCR3 failed to affect viral infection of both macrophage cell types. Antibodies to CCR5 (3A9) prevented monocyte infection but only slowed HIV replication in microglia. Thus, CCR5, not CCR3, is an essential receptor for HIV-1 infection of monocytes. Microglia express both CCR5 and CCR3, but antibodies to them fail to inhibit viral entry, suggesting the presence of other chemokine receptors for infection of these cells. These studies demonstrate the importance of mononuclear phagocyte heterogeneity in establishing HIV-1 infection and persistence.\",\"Productive replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in brain macrophages and microglia is a critical component of viral neuropathogenesis. However, how virus-macrophage interactions lead to neurological disease remains incompletely understood. Possibly, a differential ability of virus to replicate in brain tissue macrophages versus macrophages in other tissues underlies HIV-1 neurovirulence. To these ends, we established systems for the isolation and propagation of pure populations of human microglia and then analyzed the viral life cycles of divergent HIV-1 strains in these cells and in cultured monocytes by using identical viral inocula and indicator systems. The HIV-1 isolates included those isolated from blood, lung tissue, cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), and brain tissues of infected subjects: HIV-1(ADA) and HIV-1(89.6) (from peripheral blood mononuclear cells), HIV-1(DJV) and HIV-1(JR-FL) (from brain tissue), HIV-1(SF162) (from CSF), and HIV-1(BAL) (from lung tissue). The synthesis of viral nucleic acids and viral mRNA, cytopathicity, and release of progeny virions were assessed. A significant heterogeneity among macrophage-tropic isolates for infection of monocytes and microglia was demonstrated. Importantly, a complete analysis of the viral life cycle revealed no preferential differences in the abilities of the HIV-1 strains tested to replicate in microglia and/or monocytes. Macrophage tropism likely dictates the abilities of HIV-1 to invade, replicate, and incite disease within its microglial target cells.\",\"We used the rhesus macaque model of heterosexual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission to test the hypothesis that in vitro measures of macrophage tropism predict the ability of a primate lentivirus to initiate a systemic infection after intravaginal inoculation. A single atraumatic intravaginal inoculation with a T-cell-tropic molecular clone of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), SIVmac239, or a dualtropic recombinant molecular clone of SIV, SIVmac239/1A11/239, or uncloned dualtropic SIVmac251 or uncloned dualtropic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) 89.6-PD produced systemic infection in all rhesus macaques tested. However, vaginal inoculation with a dualtropic molecular clone of SIV, SIVmac1A11, resulted in transient viremia in one of two rhesus macaques. It has previously been shown that 12 intravaginal inoculations with SIVmac1A11 resulted in infection of one of five rhesus macaques (M. L. Marthas, C. J. Miller, S. Sutjipto, J. Higgins, J. Torten, B. L. Lohman, R. E. Unger, H. Kiyono, J. R. McGhee, P. A. Marx, and N. C. Pedersen, J. Med. Primatol. 21:99-107, 1992). In addition, SHIV HXBc2, which replicates in monkey macrophages, does not infect rhesus macaques following multiple vaginal inoculations, while T-cell-tropic SHIV 89.6 does (Y. Lu, P. B. Brosio, M. Lafaile, J. Li, R. G. Collman, J. Sodroski, and C. J. Miller, J. Virol. 70:3045-3050, 1996). These results demonstrate that in vitro measures of macrophage tropism do not predict if a SIV or SHIV will produce systemic infection after intravaginal inoculation of rhesus macaques. However, we did find that the level to which these viruses replicate in vivo after intravenous inoculation predicts the outcome of intravaginal inoculation with each virus.\",\"The World Health Organization estimates that 28-30 million people have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although many important questions remain, much has been learned regarding the biology of heterosexual HIV transmission. For example, most sexual transmission of HIV is probably mediated by cell-free virus. Langerhans cells in the vaginal epithelium and dendritic cells or macrophages in the lamina propria are the most likely target cells in HIV transmission. Although there is restriction in the genotypes of viruses that are sexually transmitted, the common phenotypic characteristic of these viruses does not appear to be related to in vitro measures of tropism but rather to the relatively high in vivo replicative fitness of the transmitted viral variants. Clearly, host factors such as the amount of HIV-1 co-receptor expression on host cells and the presence of ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases affect the susceptibility of an individual to HIV infection. The growing body of information has increased the likelihood that a vaccine capable of preventing HIV-1 infection after exposure during sexual activity will be developed in the foreseeable future.\",\"Retroviruses have been extensively used in the development of gene transfer systems. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the use of lentiviruses for gene transfer because they infect nondividing cells. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been the lentivirus most often used for this purpose, but its genomic complexity and limited tropism present some challenges to the establishment of efficient gene transfer systems. In this paper we present data showing intrinsic differences between the infectivity of wild-type HIV and HIV particles pseudotyped with heterologous envelope glycoproteins. Interestingly, HIV pseudotypes with envelope glycoproteins from the amphotropic murine leukemia virus or the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) are 3 and 40 times more infectious than wild-type HIV, respectively. In addition, we show that the reliance on Nef expression for maximal infectivity of HIV particles is dependent on the path of virus entry. The dependence on Nef for higher infectivity is greater for amphotropic pseudotypes and wild-type HIV than for VSV-G pseudotypes. We conclude that VSV-G pseudotypes of HIV vectors are an excellent choice for gene transfer purposes and Nef-mediated viral infectivity enhancement is affected by virus entry pathway.\",\"HIV-1 uses chemokine coreceptors for cell entry. CXCR4 is the major coreceptor for T-cell-line-adapted isolates and CCR5 for non-T-cell-line-adapted isolates. This study investigated if coreceptor usage differs between genetic subtypes of HIV-1. Eighty-one primary isolates representing nine different genetic subtypes (A-J, except I) were tested on U87.CD4 glioma cells stably expressing chemokine receptor CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4. Coreceptor usage was compared to biological phenotype of the isolates (rapid/high, syncytium-inducing or slow/low, non-syncytium-inducing) and to clinical and immunological status of the study subjects. CXCR4 usage was perfectly correlated to the biological phenotype for all subtypes; all of 26 isolates with rapid/high phenotype and none of 55 isolates with slow/low phenotype could infect the CXCR4 expressing cell line. Importantly, the CXCR4-positive, rapid/high phenotype was underrepresented among subtype C isolates. Furthermore, dual tropism for CXCR4 and CCR5 was not found among subtype D isolates. Uni- and multivariate analyses indicated that these subtype-specific differences in coreceptor usage were not due to differences in clinical status, CD4 counts, or treatment. This study shows that CXCR4 usage determines the biological phenotype for all subtypes, but that there appear to exist subtype-dependent differences in frequency of usage of certain coreceptors. This opens up the possibility that genetic subtypes may differ in important biological properties such as virulence, tissue tropism, and transmissibility.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV-1) cell-type tropism is dictated by chemokine receptor usage: T-cell line tropic viruses use CXCR4, whereas monocyte tropic viruses primarily use CCR5 as fusion coreceptors. CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) inhibit CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 cell fusion. MCP-2 is also a member of the CC chemokine subfamily and has the capacity to interact with at least two receptors including CCR-1 and CCR2B. In an effort to further characterize the binding properties of MCP-2 on leukocytes, we observed that MCP-2, but not MCP-1, effectively competed with MIP-1beta for binding to monocytes, suggesting that MCP-2 may interact with CCR5. As predicted, MCP-2 competitively inhibited MIP-1beta binding to HEK293 cells stably transfected with CCR5 (CCR5/293 cells). MCP-2 also bound to and induced chemotaxis of CCR5/293 cells with a potency comparable with that of MIP-1beta. Confocal microscopy indicates that MCP-2 caused remarkable and dose-dependent internalization of CCR5 in CCR5/293 cells. Furthermore, MCP-2 inhibited the entry/replication of HIV-1ADA in CCR5/293 cells coexpressing CD4. These results indicated that MCP-2 uses CCR5 as one of its functional receptors and is an additional potent natural inhibitor of HIV-1.\",\"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, in combination with CD4, mediate cellular entry of macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) and T-cell-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), respectively, while dualtropic viruses can use either receptor. We have constructed a panel of chimeric viruses and envelope glycoproteins in which various domains of the dualtropic HIV-1(DH12) gp160 were introduced into the genetic background of an M-tropic HIV-1 isolate, HIV-1(AD8). These constructs were employed in cell fusion and virus infectivity assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, MT4 T cells, primary monocyte-derived macrophages, or HOS-CD4 cell lines, expressing various chemokine receptors, to assess the contributions of different gp120 subdomains in coreceptor usage and cellular tropism. As expected, the dualtropic HIV-1(DH12) gp120 utilized either CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, whereas HIV-1(AD8) gp120 was able to use only CCR3 or CCR5. We found that either the V1/V2 or the V3 region of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 individually conferred on HIV-1(AD8) the ability to use CXCR4, while the combination of both the V1/V2 and V3 regions increased the efficiency of CXCR4 use. In addition, while the V4 or the V5 region of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 failed to confer the capacity to utilize CXCR4 on HIV-1(AD8), these regions were required in conjunction with regions V1 to V3 of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 for efficient utilization of CXCR4. Comparison of virus infectivity analyses with various cell types and cell fusion assays revealed assay-dependent discrepancies and indicated that events occurring at the cell surface during infection are complex and cannot always be predicted by any one assay.\",\"Most individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) initially harbor macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing (M-tropic, NSI) viruses that may evolve into T-cell-tropic, syncytium-inducing viruses (T-tropic, SI) after several years. The reasons for the more efficient transmission of M-tropic, NSI viruses and the slow evolution ofT-tropic, SI viruses remain unclear, although they may be linked to expression of appropriate chemokine coreceptors for virus entry. We have examined plasma viral RNA levels and the extent of CD4+ T-cell depletion in SCID mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood leukocytes following infection with M-tropic, dual-tropic, or T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. The cell tropism was found to determine the course of viremia, with M-tropic viruses producing sustained high viral RNA levels and sparing some CD4+ T cells, dual-tropic viruses producing a transient and lower viral RNA spike and extremely rapid depletion of CD4+ T cells, and T-tropic viruses causing similarly lower viral RNA levels and rapid-intermediate rates of CD4+ T-cell depletion. A single amino acid change in the V3 region of gp120 was sufficient to cause one isolate to switch from M-tropic to dual-tropic and acquire the ability to rapidly deplete all CD4+ T cells.\",\"We have isolated HIV-1 variants that infect brain-derived CD4-positive cells, which are resistant to both macrophage (M)-tropic and T-cell line (T)-tropic HIV-1 strains. It is possible that this brain cell tropism of the HIV-1 variants is determined by the interaction of HIV-1 with a chemokine receptor (CKR) gene. We attempted to detect the expression of the CKR-like genes using degenerate PCR primers. The brain-derived cells expressed a CKR-like gene TER1/CCR8. Human CD4-expressing cells resistant to all HIV-1 strains became susceptible to brain-cell tropic HIV-1 variants after expression of TER1 in these cells, but these cells were still resistant to M-tropic strains or T-tropic IIIB strain. TER1 was expressed in brain-derived cells and human T-cells. These findings suggest that TER1/CCR8 functions as a co-receptor for HIV-1 infection for brain-derived cells as well as T cells.\",\"Dendritic cells (DC) are required to initiate primary cellular immune responses. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of DC may be central to transmission and persistence of virus and in the pathogenesis of AIDS. In symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients the proportion of DC in the mononuclear cell population was reduced. Provirus load in the T cells was 3-100 times higher than in DC and there was no correlation between the levels of infection in the two cell types. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acids in the V3 loop and flanking regions indicated intermingling of sequences and thus provides the first evidence for transfer of virus between DC and T cells in vivo. In one of three patients analysed there were significant differences in amino acid residues in the V3 region. This may reflect reduced interactions between DC and T cells in infected individuals and for the existence of variants with a stronger tropism for DC, which could play a role in transmission by initiating infection in mucosal DC.\",\"Monocyte-macrophages can be productively infected by CCR5-specific, but not CXCR4-specific, HIV-1. This could be due either to the absence of this chemokine receptor in this cell lineage or to other, yet undefined cellular cofactors that modulate the coreceptor activity of the CXCR4 in these cells. To investigate the basis of macrophage tropism, we studied the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4, as well as several of the other CC chemokine receptors, on monocyte-macrophages at different stages of differentiation. We found that on fresh monocytes, CXCR4 was relatively abundant, but it fell to barely detectable levels in culture over 24 hr and maintained this low level of expression during differentiation in vitro. Some donor macrophages appeared to express CXCR4 at levels comparable to CCR5. In contrast, CCR5 expression was low on fresh monocytes but increased on in vitro differentiation. Taken together, the results show that monocyte-macrophage differentiation is associated with a differential expression of chemokine receptors that may contribute to, but does not fully account for, the selectivity of these cells to HIV entry. GM-CSF, a cytokine that induces macrophage differentiation, caused a rapid decrease in CXCR4 and CCR5 mRNA and was correlated with decreased ability to support HIV entry.\",\"We have continuously measured CD4-induced conformational changes of cell surface-expressed human immunodeficiency virus type-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120-gp41 in situ using 4,4'-dianilino-1, 1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonic acid, a fluorescent probe that binds to hydrophobic groups. CD4-expressing human T cell lines induced significant and rapid conformational changes (<1 min delay) in gp120-gp41 from T cell-tropic strains, and little conformational changes in gp120-gp41 from macrophage-tropic strains, with equivalent levels of envelope expression. Conversely, CD4-expressing human macrophages induced significant and rapid conformational changes in gp120-gp41 from macrophage-tropic strains, and little conformational changes in gp120-gp41 from T cell-tropic strains. Thus, the conformational changes undergone by gp120-gp41, which lead to membrane fusion, are highly cooperative and require both receptor and co-receptor. We used a dye transfer assay to show that neither membrane lipid fusion or fusion pore formation can occur with host cells having different tropism from the envelope.\",\"The cellular tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is dependent on utilization of specific chemokine co-receptor: macrophage-tropic/non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) viruses use CCR5, whereas T-cell tropic/syncytium-inducing (SI) viruses preferentially use CXCR4. We have analyzed co-receptor usage of 24 phylogenetically distinct primary HIV-1 isolates representing group M (clades A-F) and group O with known SI and NSI phenotype, using lymphocytes from donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5-/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). While all SI isolates infected CCR5-/- lymphocytes (and hence do not require CCR5 for viral entry), all NSI isolates, regardless of clade, did not infect CCR5-/- lymphocytes. Thus, CCR5 expression is required for infection with NSI isolates and the CCR5 usage is independent of viral genotype. To localize the viral determinant involved in CCR5 binding, the V3 sequences across the clades were aligned based on the CCR5 usage. There were conserved uncharged residues at position 11 of V3 (mostly serine/glycine) and negatively charged residues at residue 25 (mostly glutamic/aspartic acid) among all isolates that used CCR5, whereas substitution with arginine or glutamine at these two positions led to usage of a co-receptor other than CCR5. This analysis led us to identify a consensus motif S/GXXXGPGXXXXXXXE/D within the V3 loop that predicts CCR5 co-receptor usage. Most isolates, with exception of one isolate, containing the conserved motif and predicted to utilize CCR5 indeed had an absolute requirement of CCR5 expression for infectibility. Site-directed mutagenesis in the infectious molecular clone further confirmed these results. Taken together, these data provide evidence that sequences within the V3 loop provide important residues that might be directly or indirectly involved in binding to a CCR5 co-receptor.\",\"Laboratory-adapted (LA) macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates (e.g., HIV-1(Ba-L)) and low-passage primary (PR) isolates differed markedly in tropism for syngeneic neonatal monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and placental macrophages (PMs). Newly adherent neonatal monocytes and cultured PMs were highly refractory to infection with PR HIV-1 isolates yet were permissive for LA M-tropic isolates. Day 4 MDMs were also permissive for LA M-tropic isolates and additionally, were permissive for over half the PR isolates tested. Qualitative differences in PR HIV-1 infection of monocytes/MDMs could not be correlated with CD4 levels alone, and in all three cell types the block to PR HIV-1 strain replication preceded reverse transcription. Neonatal monocyte susceptibility to PR HIV-1 strains correlated with increasing CCR-5 expression during maturation. CCR-5 could not be detected on newly adherent (day 1) neonatal monocytes, in contrast to adult monocytes (H. Naif et al., J. Virol. 72:830-836, 1998), but was readily detectable after 4 to 7 days of culture. However, moderate CCR-5 mRNA levels were present in day 1 neonatal monocytes and remained constant during monocyte maturation. CCR-5 was not detectable on the surface of PMs, yet the receptor was present within permeabilized cells. Notably, two brain-derived PR HIV-1 isolates from a single patient, differing in their V3 loops, were discordant in their abilities to infect neonatal monocytes/MDMs and PMs, yet both isolates could infect newly adherent adult monocytes. Together these data strongly suggest that LA HIV-1 isolates are able to infect neonatal monocytes at earlier stages of maturation and lower-level expression of CCR-5 than PR isolates. The differences between neonatal and adult monocytes in susceptibility to PR isolates may also be related to the level of CCR-5 expression.\",\"Distinction criterion for various sets of fixed length peptide fragments and integral distinction measure for various sets of peptide fragments with different length and start position ranges have been introduced on the base of an enumeration procedure and a point estimators for the amino acid distribution characteristics introduced previously (M. Yu. Shchelkanov, A. N. Yudin, A. V. Antonov, N. S. Starikov, A. A. Vedenov, E. V. Karamov, J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 15, 231-241 (1997)). Differences between 6-10-mer peptides derived from the majority of HIV-1 taxon pairs are demonstrated to be located generally in the vicinity of the V3-loop top. This validates the suitability of V3 top mimicking synthetic peptides for HIV-1 serotyping. A significant difference between E subtype V3 C-terminus peptides and the corresponding peptides derived from the other subtypes has been demonstrated. Taking into account the Langerhans' cells tropism of E subtype virus variants we have hypothesized the influence of mutations in the V3 C-terminus on HIV-1 cell tropism.\",\"We studied the temporal relationship between human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) quasispecies in tissues and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of infected individuals. Sequential PBMC and tissue samples from various organs obtained at autopsy from three patients who died of AIDS-related complications were available for analysis. Biological HIV-1 clones were isolated from PBMC samples, and cellular tropism and syncytium-inducing (SI) capacity were determined. Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 cm3 of organ tissue, and proviral DNA was amplified by means of PCR and cloned with the PGEM-T vector system. A 185-bp region encompassing the third variable domain of the virus envelope, known to influence HIV-1 biological properties, was sequenced. HIV-1 could be amplified from all PBMC and organ samples, except from liver tissue for two patients. Both SI and non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) genotypes could be detected in the different tissues. Tissue-specific quasispecies were observed in brain, lung, and testis. Lymphoid tissues, such as bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen, harbored several different variants similar to those detected in blood in the last PBMC samples. In general, only tissues in which macrophages are likely to be the main target cell for HIV-1 harbored NSI HIV-1 sequences that clustered separately. Both SI and NSI sequences that clustered with sequences from late-stage PBMC were present in other tissues, which may indicate that the presence of HIV-1 in those tissues is secondary to lymphocyte infiltration rather than to tissue tropism of HIV-1 itself. These data suggest that the viral reservoir may be limited, which will have important implications for the success of HIV-1 eradication.\",\"By studying changes in the clonal composition of HIV-1 populations during the first weeks of zidovudine (ZDV) treatment before the development of ZDV resistance-conferring mutations, we demonstrated previously a selective inhibition of nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI) HIV-1, even when present as coexisting population in individuals also harboring syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1. In this study, we observed the opposite in individuals receiving didanosine (ddI) treatment. In these individuals (n = 7) a median -0.98 log change (range -1.55-0.08) in infectious cellular SI load was observed, whereas the coexisting NSI load was only minimally affected (median -0.15 log, range -1.27-0.50; P = 0.03). The virus phenotype-dependent treatment responses were independent of the clonal composition of HIV-1 populations at baseline. Individuals treated with a combination of ZDV and ddI revealed an equal decline of both NSI and SI infectious cellular load (n = 4; NSI: median -1.55 log, range -2.19 to -1.45; SI: median -1.47 log, range -1.81 to -0.86; P = 0.56). To test the hypothesis that the previously reported optimal activation of ZDV and ddI in activated and resting T cells, respectively, in combination with the differential T cell tropism of NSI and SI HIV-1 is the basis for the observed virus phenotype specific efficacy of nucleoside analogs, we studied the effect of treatment with a protease inhibitor that does not require intracellular activation. Individuals receiving ritonavir (n = 4) indeed showed equal declines in NSI and SI infectious cellular load (NSI: median -2.37 log, range -2.59 to -2.16; SI: median -2.82 log, range -3.14 to -2.50; P = 0.25). Our data suggest HIV-1 phenotype as an additional parameter in the design of optimal treatment regimens.\",\"Infection of the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 with NL4-3, a molecularly cloned HIV-1 strain that productively infects T cells, results in adaptation of the virus and production of a variant, NL4-3(M). Unlike NL4-3, NL4-3(M) has a rapid cytopathic effect in HL-60 and other myeloid cell lines. To demonstrate that the tropism of NL4-3(M) is extended to primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and to determine whether the envelope gene, env, of NL4-3(M) is responsible for cytopathicity in HL-60 cells and replication in MDM. A chimeric virus (NL4-3envA) containing the majority of env of NL4-3(M) was generated, and tested for virus replication and cytopathic effect in H9 and HL-60 cells, as well as for virus replication in primary MDM. To assess virus replication, the cultures were analyzed for expression of viral envelope glycoproteins on the infected cells and production of extracellular HIV-1 p24 antigen. Cytopathic effect on HL-60 cells was evaluated by monitoring the viabilities of the cultures. In addition, the majority of env of NL4-3envA was sequenced. The biological phenotypes of NL4-3, NL4-3(M), and NL4-3envA are distinctly different. Although both NL4-3(M) and NL4-3envA replicate in MDM, only NL4-3(M) is rapidly cytopathic in HL-60 cells. Nine amino-acid changes were identified within the envelope glycoproteins of NL4-3envA compared with NL4-3. The viral determinants of NL4-3(M) sufficient to extend the tropism of this virus to MDM reside, in part, in env. These genetic determinants are distinct from the viral determinants that control the cytopathic phenotype of this virus in HL-60 cells.\",\"The pathogenesis of HIV infection involves a complex interplay between both the infected and noninfected cells of human lymphoid tissue, the release of free viral particles, the de novo infection of cells, and the recirculatory trafficking of peripheral blood lymphocytes. To develop an in vitro model for studying these various aspects of HIV pathogenesis we have utilized blocks of surgically excised human tonsils and a rotating wall vessel (RWV) cell culture system. Here we show that (1) fragments of the surgically excised human lymphoid tissue remain viable and retain their gross cytoarchitecture for at least 3 weeks when cultured in the RWV system; (2) such lymphoid tissue gradually shows a loss of both T and B cells to the surrounding growth medium; however, this cellular migration is reversible as demonstrated by repopulation of the tissue by labeled cells from the growth medium; (3) this cellular migration may be partially or completely inhibited by embedding the blocks of lymphoid tissue in either a collagen or agarose gel matrix; these embedded tissue blocks retain most of the basic elements of a normal lymphoid cytoarchitecture; and (4) both embedded and nonembedded RWV-cultured blocks of human lymphoid tissue are capable of productive infection by HIV-1 of at least three various strains of different tropism and phenotype, as shown by an increase in both p24 antigen levels and free virus in the culture medium, and by the demonstration of HIV-1 RNA-positive cells inside the tissue identified by in situ hybridization. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that gel-embedded and nonembedded blocks of human lymphoid tissue, cocultured with a suspension of tonsillar lymphocytes in an RWV culture system, constitute a useful model for simulating normal lymphocyte recirculatory traffic and provide a new tool for testing the various aspects of HIV pathogenesis.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) enter target cells by forming a complex between the viral envelope protein and two cell-surface membrane receptors: CD4 and a 7-span transmembrane chemokine receptor. Isolates of HIV that differ in cellular tropism use different subsets of chemokine receptors as entry cofactors: macrophage-tropic HIVs primarily use CCR5, whereas T-cell-tropic and dual-tropic isolates use CXCR4 receptors. HIV-mediated signal transduction through CCR5 is not required for efficient fusion and entry of HIV in vitro. Here we show that recombinant envelope proteins from macrophage-tropic HIV and SIV induce a signal through CCR5 on CD4+ T cells and that envelope-mediated signal transduction through CCR5 induces chemotaxis of T cells. This chemotactic response may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV in vivo by chemo-attracting activated CD4+ cells to sites of viral replication. HIV-mediated signalling through CCR5 may also enhance viral replication in vivo by increasing the activation state of target cells. Alternatively, envelope-mediated CCR5 signal transduction may influence viral-associated cytopathicity or apoptosis.\",\"Long-term non-progression in HIV-1-infected patients has been reported to be associated with a 32 base-pair deletion (delta32) in one CCR-5 allele. The normal gene product acts as a coreceptor for HIV cell entry and is essential for infection of cells by non-syncytium-inducing and MT-2-negative HIV-1 strains. Forty individuals were studied, all of whom had been HIV-1-seropositive for a mean of 8 years. Eight (20%) were heterozygous for the CCR-5 allele delta32 deletion. Six of these eight patients harboured MT-2-negative HIV-1 strains. Of these six, three were long-term non-progressors with a positive CD4 cell slope, not receiving antiretroviral treatment, whereas the other three were progressors (mean CD4 cell decline, 3.8 x 10(6)/l per month) receiving antiretroviral combination therapy. Two of the eight patients with the delta32 deletion had MT-2-positive HIV-1 strains. Both had very rapid CD4 cell decline (6.7 and 7.6 x 10(6)/l per month, respectively), despite triple antiretroviral therapy including a protease inhibitor. One of the patients with an MT-2-positive virus strain has suffered from Pneumocystis carinii bronchitis and the other from cytomegalovirus colitis. Disease progression may also occur in individuals with the coreceptor deficiency, especially in association with MT-2-positive HIV-1 strains. It is suggested that MT-2-positive HIV-1 enters cells through the CXC chemokine receptor-4 fusin coreceptor, thus circumventing the defective CC chemokine receptor-5 coreceptor. Various levels of expression of the wild-type CCR-5 gene and the gene with the delta32 deletion might explain variations in the disease progression in heterozygous patients with MT-2-negative HIV-1 strains.\",\"A primary isolate (KMT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistant to recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4) was isolated from an HIV-1-infected individual and grown in a T lymphoid cell line. KMT isolate passaged on CEM cells (KMT/CEM) was still resistant to rsCD4. The V1/V2 and V3 regions of the viral envelope glycoprotein are thought to be involved in various biological phenotypes. To determine the exact envelope region of the KMT isolate responsible for sensitivity to rsCD4 and cellular tropism, we performed sequence analysis of KMT and KMT/CEM isolates. Sequence analysis of the KMT isolate showed that the sequence of the V3 region was relatively homogeneous, whereas a considerable heterogeneity of the V1/V2 region was noted. In contrast, the sequences of the V1 to V3 regions were homogeneous in KMT/CEM isolates. Analysis of NL4-3-based recombinant viruses with amplified sequences of the V1 to V3 regions from KMT and KMT/CEM isolates showed that the V1/V2 region modulated the sensitivity to rsCD4. A change in resistance to rsCD4 by the V1/V2 region was associated with the ability of the isolate to replicate in macrophages and efficiently replicate in T lymphoid cell lines. A change to an isolate sensitive to rsCD4 was associated with reduced replication efficiency in T lymphoid cell lines. Our results suggest that the V1/V2 region is involved in modulating the sensitivity to rsCD4, macrophage tropism, and replication efficiency in T lymphoid cell lines.\",\"To test the hypothesis that some subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), especially subtype E, are more likely to infect mature Langerhans cells (mLC), we titrated a panel of 26 primary HIV-1 isolates of subtypes A through F on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and mLC. The majority of HIV-1 isolates from heterosexually infected patients did not show a preferred tropism for mLC compared to homosexually transmitted HIV-1 isolates. Only 6 of 26 isolates, 2 from patients infected by homosexual contact and 4 from patients infected by heterosexual contact, showed a higher infectivity for mLC than for PBMC. Both syncytium-inducing and non-syncytium-inducing isolates were able to infect mLC which express mRNA for the chemokine receptors CCR3, CCR5, and CXCR4.\",\"A report that genetic subtype E human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains display a preferential tropism for Langerhans cells (epidermal dendritic cells [DCs]) compared to genetic subtype B strains suggested a possible explanation for the rapid heterosexual spread of subtype E strains in Thailand (L. E. Soto-Ramirez et al., Science 271:1291-1293, 1996). In an independent system, we applied subtype E and B isolates to skin leukocytes, since skin is a relevant model for the histologically comparable surfaces of the vagina and ectocervix. Isolates of both HIV-1 subtypes infected DC-T-cell mixtures, and no subtype-specific pattern of infection was observed. Purified DCs did not support the replication of strains of either subtype B or E. Our findings do not support the conclusion that subtype E strains have a preferential tropism for DCs, suggesting that other explanations for the rapid heterosexual spread of subtype E strains in Asia should be considered.\",\"The chemokine receptor CCR5 acts as an essential cofactor for cell entry by macrophage-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains, whereas CXCR4 acts as an essential cofactor for T-cell-line-adapted strains. We demonstrated that the specific amino acids in the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope protein that determine cellular tropism also regulate chemokine coreceptor preference for cell entry by the virus. Further, a strong correlation was found between HIV-1 strains classified as syncytium inducing in standard assays and those using CXCR4 as a coreceptor. These data support the hypothesis that progressive adaptation to additional coreceptors is a key molecular basis for HIV-1 phenotypic evolution in vivo.\",\"The recent identification of coreceptors that mediate efficient entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) suggests new therapeutic and preventive strategies. We analyzed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) entry cofactors to investigate whether the macaque SIV model can be used as an experimental model to evaluate these strategies. Similar to primary HIV-1 isolates, a well-characterized molecular clone, SIVmac239, which replicates poorly but efficiently enters into rhesus alveolar macrophages and an envelope variant, SIVmac239/316Env, with an approximately 1,000-fold-higher replicative capacity in macrophages used the beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 for efficient entry. The transmembrane portion of 316Env allowed low-level entry into cells expressing CCR1, CCR2B, and CCR3. A single amino acid substitution in the V3 loop of SIVmac239/316Env, 321P-->S, impaired the ability to enter into the T-B hybrid cell line CEMx174 but had relatively little effect on entry into primary cells and HOS.CD4 cells expressing CCR5. Although CEMx174 cells do not express CCR5, most SIVmac variants entered this hybrid cell line efficiently but did not enter the parental T-cell line CEM. It seems likely that CEMx174 cells express an as-yet-unidentified, perhaps B-cell-derived cofactor which allows efficient entry of SIVmac.\",\"CD4-expressing T cells in lymphoid organs are infected by the primary strains of HIV and represent one of the main sources of virus replication. Gene therapy strategies are being developed that allow the transfer of exogenous genes into CD4(+) T lymphocytes whose expression might prevent viral infection or replication. Insights into the mechanisms that govern virus entry into the target cells can be exploited for this purpose. Major determinants of the tropism of infection are the CD4 molecules on the surface of the target cells and the viral envelope glycoproteins at the viral surface. The best characterized and most widely used gene transfer vectors are derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). To generate MuLV-based retroviral gene transfer vector particles with specificity of infection for CD4-expressing cells, we attempted to produce viral pseudotypes, consisting of MuLV capsid particles and the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) envelope glycoproteins gp120-SU and gp41-TM of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Full-length HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were expressed in the MuLV env-negative packaging cell line TELCeB6. Formation of infectious pseudotype particles was not observed. However, using a truncated variant of the transmembrane protein, lacking sequences of the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, pseudotyped retroviruses were generated. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the transmembrane envelope protein of HIV-1 was therefore absolutely required for the generation of the viral pseudotypes. The virus was shown to infect CD4-expressing cell lines, and infection was prevented by antisera specific for gp120-SU. This retroviral vector should prove useful for the study of HIV infection events mediated by HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and for the targeting of CD4(+) cells during gene therapy of AIDS.\",\"Neurologic abnormalities are common in HIV-1 infected patients and often represent the dominant clinical manifestation of pediatric AIDS. Although the neurological dysfunction has been directly related to CNS invasion by HIV-1, the pathogenesis of neurologic disorders remains unclear. Microglia and macrophages are major HIV-1 targets in the brain, whereas HIV-1 infected neurons or glial cells have been rarely reported. This suggests that indirect mechanisms may account for the severe neuronal damage observed in these patients. Nevertheless, immature, mitotically active neuronal and glial cells, which are present during fetal development, are susceptible to HIV-1 infection and replication in vitro, suggesting that HIV-1 infection during organ development may present unique features. To better characterize virus-host cells interactions in the developing CNS, we have examined the susceptibility of embryologically and biochemically distinct neuronal cell lines to HIV-1 infection. Here we show that mitotically active, immature neurons of distinct lineages, have different susceptibilities to HIV-1 infection and replication and different abilities to support viral gene expression. Mutational analysis of HIV-1 LTR reveals that a region of the viral promoter between nucleotide -255 to -166 is responsible for most quantitative and qualitative differences in viral transactivation among different neuroblasts. This suggests that specific regions of the viral promoter and cellular factors, either lineage- or differentiation-dependent, which bind to those regions, may contribute to control the levels of virus replication and possibly restrict the viral tropism in the developing brain. This may contribute to the establishment of a virus reservoir in the immature CNS and participate by either direct or indirect mechanisms to the severity of the AIDS-related pediatric neurological dysfunction.\",\"NaN\",\"To study the apoptosis-inducing capacity of HIV-1 primary isolates in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in relation to the viral biological phenotype. Four HIV-1 primary isolates capable of replicating and inducing syncytia in the MT-2 cell line and two primary isolates lacking these properties were used to infect PBMC with the same infectious doses. The kinetics of virus production in the culture supernatants were followed in relation to apoptosis induction in PBMC as determined by intracellular labelling of apoptotic DNA strand breaks and flow cytometry analysis. When low virus dose was used (0.001 m.o.i.), productive virus infection, with peak reverse transcriptase (RT) activity at days 5-7, was followed by high numbers of apoptotic cells at day 10 post infection. Tenfold higher inoculum dose (0.01 m.o.i.) resulted in enhanced virus production with peak RT activity at day 3 followed by high numbers of apoptotic cells at day 5 after infection. The apoptosis-inducing capacity of virus isolates was independent of their capacity to induce syncytia or replicate in the MT-2 cell line. However, upon cocultivation of infected PBMC with MT-2 cells, only virus with the MT-2 tropic phenotype initiated productive infection and induced apoptosis in MT-2 cells. These results show that apoptosis induction in PBMC by primary HIV-1 isolates is closely related to the kinetics of virus replication but is not influenced by other biological properties of the virus such as syncytium-inducing capacity and MT-2 tropism.\",\"Filamentous bacteriophages infecting gram-negative bacteria display tropism for a variety of pilus structures. However, the obligatory coreceptor of phage infection, postulated from genetic studies, has remained elusive. Here we identify the C-terminal domain of the periplasmic protein TolA as the coreceptor for infection of Escherichia coli by phage fd and the N-terminal domain of the phage minor coat protein g3p as its cognate ligand. The neighboring g3p domain binds the primary receptor of phage infection, the F pilus, and blocks TolA binding in its absence. Contact with the pilus releases this blockage during infection. Our findings support a sequential two-way docking mechanism for phage infection, analogous to infection pathways proposed for a range of eukaryotic viruses including herpes simplex, adenoviruses, and also lentiviruses like HIV-1.\",\"To study the role of HIV-1 biological phenotype, viral load and neutralizing antibodies in male-to-female heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. Seven transmitting and seven non-transmitting HIV-1-seropositive heterosexual male index cases were included in the present study. All couples had engaged in unprotected sex for a period of over 1 year. Transmission was defined by the seroconversion of the female sexual partner. Virus isolates were tested in MT-2 cells for replication and syncytia induction. HIV-1 RNA plasma load was measured by the branched DNA technique. Serum neutralizing activity to primary HIV-1 isolates was tested by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as target cells. Non-transmitting index cases had a lower HIV-1 RNA concentration in plasma than transmitting index cases. Non-transmitting index cases also tended to have serum neutralizing activity with broad specificity and to have viruses with low replicative capacity, as characterized by 50% infectious dose titres in PBMC and by the lack of MT-2 tropism. The results indicate that plasma viral-RNA load is a marker for transmission. Moreover, an interplay between the host immune response and viral replication may modulate the level of viral load and thereby influence HIV-1 transmission.\",\"At the cell surface, chemokine receptors and CD4 act in concert to bind to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and trigger its entry into and infection of cells. Several different chemokine receptors can act as co-receptors for HIV entry, although either CCR5 or CXCR4 is used by all HIV-1 strains studied so far. The capacity of different HIV strains to exploit different chemokine receptors influences their cell tropism, cytopathicity and pathogenicity. Chemokines, the natural ligands for these receptors, can block HIV entry and are thus potential starting points for the design of novel therapeutic agents against HIV infection.\",\"Microglia, alveolar macrophages, and Langerhans cells are representatives of cells of macrophage lineage that are susceptible to infection with HIV-1 and they play important roles in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, and systemic viral invasion from mucosal surfaces, respectively. In contrast, elimination of CD4+ T cells with resultant development of immunosuppression and AIDS is thought to be reflective of the exclusive tropism of the virus for CD4+ T cells. Examination of these concepts in macaques infected with molecularly cloned strains of SIVmac suggested that all strains of the virus are both macrophage- and lymphocyte-tropic and that all aspects of pathogenesis including loss of CD4+ T cells are dependent on infection in both cell types. However, viral clones that caused productive lytic infection in macrophages were less virulent than those which caused persistent nonproductive infection. The former caused subclinical and even immunizing infections, whereas the latter caused activation and productive infection in CD4+ T cells, AIDS, and systemic infection, even after inoculation of the virus on mucosal surfaces. If these findings on SIVmac are relevant to HIV-1 disease, then demonstration that HIV-1 isolates are macrophage-tropic probably does not necessarily correlate with their pathogenic potential.\",\"Primary HIV-1 isolates can be distinguished by phenotypic qualities such as the ability to productively infect cells of established CD4-positive lines and to induce syncytia in MT-2 cells. Such viral phenotypes have also been reported to confer host cell specificity. It is perceived that primary isolates with the syncytium-inducing phenotype (SI or rapid/high) are T cell tropic and are therefore unable to infect primary cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. However, we have consistently found that these isolates are as capable of establishing infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) as the monocytotropic, non-syncytium-inducing variants (NSI or slow/low). It is known that differentiation, activation, and proliferation of human monocytes are affected by both isolation methods and culture conditions. Therefore, to test whether our inability to discriminate macrophage tropic HIV-1 isolates could be explained by differences in culturing techniques, we isolated monocytes by elutriation or short-term adherence and allowed the cells to mature and differentiate in either the presence or absence of autologous lymphocytes. After removal of nonadherent cells, MDM were infected with a panel of SI and NSI primary HIV-1 isolates. MDM were susceptible to infection by the SI as well as the NSI isolates, regardless of whether or not the cells were allowed to mature in the presence of autologous lymphocytes. However, MDM matured in the presence of autologous lymphocytes replicated HIV-1 isolates (both NSI and SI) to a higher titre than MDM matured in the absence of lymphocytes. In light of these findings and recently published reports on HIV-1 phenotype and chemokine receptor usage we believe that the term macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 is no longer appropriate.\",\"Polyanionic compounds are known to inhibit the binding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to CD4+ cells and the subsequent fusion step between the virus and cells. We selected an HIV-1 strain resistant to dextran sulfate (DS) by cultivation of HIV-1 (NL4-3)-infected MT-4 cells in the presence of DS Mr 5000. DS did not inhibit the binding of DS-resistant virus to MT-4 cells or syncytium formation between MOLT cells and HUT-78 cells persistently infected with the DS-resistant virus. In addition, a monoclonal antibody with specificity for the V3 loop of envelope gp120 glycoprotein did not recognize the DS-resistant HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop. The following mutations were found in the gp120 molecule of the DS-resistant HIV-1 strain but not in the wild-type strain: S114N in the V1 loop region; S134N in the V2 loop region; K269E, Q278H, and N293D in the V3 loop region; N323S in the C3 region; a deletion of five amino acids (Phe-Asn-Ser-Thr-Trp) at positions 364-368 in the V4 loop; and R3871 in the CD4 binding domain. Our results suggest that (i) DS interacts with specific amino acid residues in the gp120 molecule, (ii) the virus is able to overcome the inhibitory effect of DS on viral infectivity, (iii) cross-resistance developed against those polyanionic compounds that are structurally related to DS, and (iv) the molecular determinants of HIV cell tropism, syncytium-inducing ability, coreceptor (fusin/ CC-CKR5) utilization, and polyanion resistance seem to be located in the env genome of HIV and specifically in the V3 loop domain.\",\"In order to characterize the biological properties of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants from different tissues (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC], lymph node, spleen, brain, and lung) of one patient, we have chosen long-range PCR to amplify virtually full-length HIV proviruses and to construct replication-competent viruses by adding a patient-specific 5' long terminal repeat. To avoid selection during propagation in CD4+ target cells, we transfected 293 cells and used the supernatants from these cells as challenge viruses for tropism studies after titration on human PBMC. Despite differences in the V3 loop of the major variants found in brain and lung compared to lymphoid tissues all recombinant HIV clones obtained showed identical cell tropism and replicative kinetics. After infection of human PBMC these viruses replicated with similar kinetics, with a slow/low-titer, non-syncytium-inducing phenotype. In contrast to the prediction of macrophage tropism, drawn from the V3 loop sequence, none of these viruses infected monocyte-derived macrophages. The challenge of blood dendritic cells by these recombinant viruses in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-4 resulted in a productive infection only after adding stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes. Therefore, the biological properties of the HIV-1 variants derived from nonlymphoid tissue of this patient did not differ from those of HIV-1 variants from lymphoid tissue with respect to tropism for primary cells such as PBMC, macrophages, and blood dendritic cells.\",\"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 functions as a fusion coreceptor for T cell tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 strains. To identify regions of CXCR4 that are important for coreceptor function, CXCR4-CXCR2 receptor chimeras were tested for the ability to support HIV-1 envelope (env) protein-mediated membrane fusion. Receptor chimeras containing the first and second extracellular loops of CXCR4 supported fusion by T tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains and binding of a monoclonal antibody to CXCR4, 12G5, that blocks CXCR4-dependent infection by some virus strains. The second extracellular loop of CXCR4 was sufficient to confer coreceptor function to CXCR2 for most virus strains tested but did not support binding of 12G5. Truncation of the CXCR4 cytoplasmic tail or mutation of a conserved DRY motif in the second intracellular loop did not affect coreceptor function, indicating that phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail and the DRY motif are not required for coreceptor function. The results implicate the involvement of multiple CXCR4 domains in HIV-1 coreceptor function, especially the second extracellular loop, though the structural requirements for coreceptor function were somewhat variable for different env proteins. Finally, a hybrid receptor in which the amino terminus of CXCR4 was replaced by that of CCR5 was active as a coreceptor for M tropic, T tropic, and dual-tropic env proteins. We propose that dual tropism may evolve in CCR5-restricted HIV-1 strains through acquisition of the ability to utilize the first and second extracellular loops of CXCR4 while retaining the ability to interact with the CCR5 amino-terminal domain.\",\"The emergence of T cell-tropic, syncytium-inducing (T-tropic/SI) HIV-1 variants from the background of macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing (M-tropic/NSI) strains is associated with disease progression in infected individuals. HIV89.6 is a primary isolate with a transitional phenotype: like M-tropic strains it replicates in primary macrophages and lymphocytes but not in most transformed cells, yet it is also syncytium inducing. We have shown that HIV89.6 can utilize both the M-tropic and T-tropic cofactors CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, in conjunction with CD4 for fusion and entry into otherwise nonpermissive nonhuman cells. To better understand the nature of restricted HIV89.6 infection of transformed cells, we analyzed its interaction with CD4-expressing transformed human HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-Gal cells, which contain the beta-galactosidase gene linked to the HIV-1 LTR. Here we show that HIV89.6 enters these cells and undergoes reverse transcription and integration. Furthermore, HIV89.6 induces LTR-driven beta-galactosidase expression, indicating Tat-dependent trans-activation, in a similar number of cells as the permissive T-tropic/SI isolate HIV(HXB). Acute infection with HIV89.6, however, produces markedly lower levels of p24 antigen and infectious virus per trans-activation-positive cell than HIV(HXB). In contrast, transfection results in high levels of expression for both viruses but HIV89.6 still fails to establish spreading infection. HIV89.6 is also blocked after entry in two other nonpermissive cell lines, SUP-T1 and U937. HIV89.6 arrest in HeLaCD4-LTR/beta-Gal cells at a stage subsequent to entry, reverse transcription, integration, and Tat expression is a novel level at which HIV-1 strain- and cell-specific restrictions define host cell tropism. These studies emphasize that complex patterns of tropism are determined by the interplay of permissive or restricted virus-cell interactions at multiple steps in the replication cycle.\",\"Isolation of infectious molecular clones has been valuable to our understanding of HIV-1-induced pathogenesis. Two infectious molecular clones of HIV-1 were isolated longitudinally from a seropositive subject at different stages of the disease, using a standard bacteriophage lambda vector and a novel progressive amplification procedure. We found the progressive amplification procedure was simpler and more specific than the conventional plaque hybridization assay. The two infectious HIV-1 clones had distinct cell tropism and cytopathic properties. The HIV-1 clone obtained at the asymptomatic stage of the disease was macrophage tropic and had a non-syncytium-inducing property. In contrast, the HIV-1 clone obtained at the stage of AIDS development was dual tropic for T cells and macrophages and induced syncytia. A detailed analysis of the restriction sites of the two clones showed 9 of 21 sites to be unique. These unique restriction sites were predominantly localized in the envelope region. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire gp120 region supported the results from the restriction analysis and showed that these two clones are closely related, and the differences are restricted to the variable domains. The difference in amino acid sequences in the V3 region may explain the observed differences in T cell tropism and syncytium-inducing properties. Availability of two distinct infectious molecular clones from the same patient at different stages of the disease may be useful in studies on the mechanism of HIV-1 pathogenesis.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) primary isolates differ in replicative capacity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tropism for primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and T-cell lines and syncytium-inducing (SI) capability on MT-2 cells in vitro. To assess the role of viral phenotype in mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission and the progression of vertically acquired HIV-1 infection, we studied 57 HIV-1-infected women at the time of delivery and 24 HIV-1-infected infants. Eight mothers transmitted the infection to their children. Primary isolates, obtained from 7 and 33 transmitting and non-transmitting mothers, respectively, differed in replicative capacity and SI activity, and no significant differences between the two groups were found regarding these viral properties. However, all primary isolates from transmitting mothers, but about half of those from non-transmitting mothers, were able to infect and replicate in MDM, regardless of their replicative capacity and/or SI activity; moreover, the monocyto-macrophage tropism of the maternal isolate correlated with an increased risk of transmission. Viral isolates from HIV-1-infected children were typed before 2 months of age; all but four showed a tropism for MDM, further supporting the notion that monocyto-macrophage tropic variants are selectively transmitted from mother to child and/or selectively replicated upon transmission. Clinical follow-up disclosed that 7/11 infants with a rapid/high replicating virus but none of the 17 with a slow replicating virus developed severe symptoms of disease and/or severe immunodepression by 1 year of age. By means of competitive RNA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a relationship was found between viral phenotype and dynamics of HIV-1 replication early in life in children who experienced different patterns of disease progression.\",\"Herpesvirus saimiri strain C488 transforms human CD4+ T-lymphocytes to continuous interleukin-2-dependent growth. Unlike human T-cell lines derived from tumours or those transformed by human T-lymphotropic virus 1, herpesvirus saimiri-immortalized T-cells (HVS T-cells) retain many functions of primary activated T-lymphocytes. We have characterized the course of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1/-2) infection in three HVS T-cell lines. Our results confirm that HVS T-cells are highly permissive to both HIV-1/-2 prototype viruses and to poorly replicating HIV-2 strains of restricted cell tropism. However, the infection was persistently productive for up to 5 months. The down-regulation of surface CD4 molecules was delayed and virus yields significantly exceeded those obtained in T-cell lines.\",\"Molecular analyses were done for the V3 region quasispecies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the first HIV-1-infected long-term-nonprogressing mother-child pair whose members have survived for >13 years with stable CD4 T cell counts. There was a predominance of lower V3 loop charge and the absence of genotypic changes that are critical in phenotypic determination and tropism during HIV-1 infection. The intrahost genetic diversity between HIV-1 strains from the mother-child pair compared with HIV-1 strains from slow and rapid progressors suggested that a high genetic heterogeneity in HIV-1 strains from this HIV-1-infected long-term-nonprogressing mother and child pair was directly proportional to the length of their immunocompetent period.\",\"Monocytes and dendritic cells are infected by HIV-1 and subsequently produce virions that initiate further rounds of infection. Current methods for the isolation and study of dendritic cells are hampered by the low frequency of these cells and contamination with other cell types. A two-step culture method was devised to generate large numbers of either dendritic cells or monocytes from fetal liver CD34+ progenitors. CD34+ cells were first expanded with the growth factors granulocyte-macrophage CSF and stem cell factor to generate a population of intermediate progenitor cells with a relatively immature phenotype. To induce specific differentiation to dendritic cells, the cultures were switched to serum-free medium with the growth factors granulocyte-macrophage CSF, stem cell factor, TNF-alpha, and IL-4. The cells became highly positive for HLA class II Ags and the dendritic cell marker CD1a. Culture of the intermediate progenitors in serum-containing medium with macrophage CSF resulted in differentiation to adherent monocytes expressing high levels of CD14 with low CD1a expression. The intermediate progenitors were permissive for HIV infection by both monocyte- and lymphocyte-tropic strains. In contrast, differentiation to monocytes or dendritic cells resulted in restricted viral tropism. Dendritic cells efficiently replicated the lymphocyte-tropic virus HIV-1MN, but not the monocyte-tropic virus HIV-1ADA. As expected, monocytes only supported replication of HIV-1ADA. This two-step culture method allows for the production of large numbers of monocytes or dendritic cells from a common precursor pool for studying the development of tropism-associated events.\",\"We have examined both the sequence changes in the LTR, gag, vif, vpr, vpx, tat, rev, vpu, env, and nef genes and the cell tropism of a cell-free stock of chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a pig-tailed macaque (PNb) that developed AIDS. This virus (SHIVKU-1) is highly pathogenic when inoculated into other macaques. DNA sequence analysis of PCR-amplified products revealed a total of 5 nucleotide changes in the LTR while vif had 2 consensus amino acid changes. The gag, vif, and vpx had no consensus amino acid substitutions, whereas vpr had 1 consensus substitution. The tat and rev genes of the HXB2 region of SHIVKU-1 had 2 and 1 consensus amino acid changes, respectively. The vpu gene of the HXB2 region of SHIV, which originally had an ACG at the beginning of the gene, reverted to an initiation ATG codon and in addition contained a consensus amino acid substitution at position 69 of this protein. As expected, the majority of the nucleotide substitutions were found in the env and nef genes. Thirteen and 5 amino acid changes were predicted for the corresponding Env and Nef proteins, respectively. In addition, one-third of the env gene clones isolated from the SHIVKU-1 stock had a 5-amino-acid deletion in the V4 region. Using three independent assays, we determined that the changes in the SHIVKU-1 were associated with an increase in the efficiency of replication in macrophages. The strikingly few consensus changes in the virus suggest that conversion of this virus to one capable of causing AIDS in pig-tailed macaques was associated with relatively few changes in the viral envelope and/or accessory genes. These results will provide the basis for the development of a pathogenic, molecular clone of SHIV capable of causing AIDS in pig-tailed macaques.\",\"Chemokine receptors serve as coreceptors for HIV entry into CD4+ cells. Their expression is thought to determine the tropism of viral strains for different cell types, and also to influence susceptibility to infection and rates of disease progression. Of the chemokine receptors, CCR5 is the most important for viral transmission, since CCR5 is the principal receptor for primary, macrophage-tropic viruses, and individuals homozygous for a defective CCR5 allele (delta32/delta32) are highly resistant to infection with HIV-1. In this study, CCR5-specific mAbs were generated using transfectants expressing high levels of CCR5. The specificity of these mAbs was confirmed using a broad panel of chemokine receptor transfectants, and by their non-reactivity with T cells from delta32/delta32 individuals. CCR5 showed a distinct pattern of expression, being abundant on long-term activated, IL-2-stimulated T cells, on a subset of effector/memory T cells in blood, and on tissue macrophages. A comparison of normal and CCR5 delta32 heterozygotes revealed markedly reduced expression of CCR5 on T cells from the heterozygotes. There was considerable individual to individual variability in the expression of CCR5 on blood T cells, that related to factors other than CCR5 genotype. Low expression of CCR5 correlated with the reduced infectability of T cells with macrophage-tropic HIV-1, in vitro. Anti-CCR5 mAbs inhibited the infection of PBMC by macrophage-tropic HIV-1 in vitro, but did not inhibit infection by T cell-tropic virus. Anti-CCR5 mAbs were poor inhibitors of chemokine binding, indicating that HIV-1 and ligands bind to separate, but overlapping regions of CCR5. These results illustrate many of the important biological features of CCR5, and demonstrate the feasibility of blocking macrophage-tropic HIV-1 entry into cells with an anti-CCR5 reagent.\",\"NaN\",\"We have studied the role of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor, CXCR-4, in the entry and fusion of syncytium-inducing strains of HIV-1. Progressive deletions were introduced in the N-terminal extracellular domain of CXCR-4 and the effect on infection by different isolates was tested. Infection of cells expressing the different CXCR-4 deletion mutants by HIV-1 LAI and 89.6 was reduced only about twofold. In contrast, the HIV-1 GUN-1 and RF isolates were substantially more impaired in their ability to mediate cell-free infection and cell-cell fusion. Since LAI and RF are T-cell line-tropic viruses while 89.6 and GUN-1 are dual tropic, no clear correlation between tropism and requirements for CXCR-4 N-terminal sequences emerged. We also introduced point mutations at the two N-linked glycosylation sites. The isolates tested (LAI, RF, GUN-1, and 89.6) were not affected by the removal of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in CXCR-4. We conclude that distinct virus strains interact differently with the CXCR-4 coreceptor and that the N-terminal extracellular domain is not the sole functional domain important for HIV-1 entry.\",\"The envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) consists of a complex of gp120 and gp41. gp120 determines viral tropism by binding to target-cell receptors, while gp41 mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Previous studies identified an alpha-helical domain within gp41 composed of a trimer of two interacting peptides. The crystal structure of this complex, composed of the peptides N36 and C34, is a six-helical bundle. Three N36 helices form an interior, parallel coiled-coil trimer, while three C34 helices pack in an oblique, antiparallel manner into highly conserved, hydrophobic grooves on the surface of this trimer. This structure shows striking similarity to the low-pH-induced conformation of influenza hemagglutinin and likely represents the core of fusion-active gp41. Avenues for the design/discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of HIV infection are directly suggested by this structure.\",\"Certain chemokine receptors serve as cofactors for HIV type 1 envelope (env)-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus infection of CD4-positive cells. Macrophage tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 isolates use CCR5, and T cell tropic (T-tropic) strains use CXCR4. To investigate the cofactors used by simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), we tested four T-tropic and two M-tropic SIV env proteins for their ability to mediate cell-cell fusion with cells expressing CD4 and either human or nonhuman primate chemokine receptors. Unlike HIV-1, both M- and T-tropic SIV envs used CCR5 but not CXCR4 or the other chemokine receptors tested. However, by testing a panel of CCR5/CCR2b chimeras, we found that the structural requirements for CCR5 utilization by M-tropic and T-tropic SIV strains were different. T-tropic SIV strains required the second extracellular loop of CCR5 whereas a closely related M-tropic SIV strain could, like M-tropic HIV-1 strains, use the amino-terminal domain of CCR5. As few as two amino acid changes in the SIV env V3 domain affected the regions of CCR5 that were critical for fusogenic activity. Receptor signaling was not required for either fusion or infection. Our results suggest that viral tropism may be influenced not only by the coreceptors used by a given virus strain but also by how a given coreceptor is used.\",\"It is now apparent that HIV infection leads to a gradual collapse of a complex system of lymphoid tissue. This collapse tends to be associated with a change in virus tropism from macrophages to T lymphocytes, and a change in phenotype from nonsyncytium inducing (NSI) to syncytium inducing (SI). An experimental system is required to study the role of this change in HIV pathogenesis in lymphoid tissue. Here we describe such a system. Histocultures of human lymphoid tissue preserve their general cytoarchitecture, including a network of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Histocultures of tonsils, adenoids, or lymph nodes support productive infection with various laboratory and primary isolates of HIV-1 of different tropism and phenotype and exhibit isolate-dependent CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion. A strong correlation between the extent of CD4+ T cell depletion and the SI/NSI phenotype of the isolates is demonstrated. AZT was used as a model drug to inhibit viral replication and CD4+ T cell depletion in lymphoid histocultures. HIV pathogenesis and the effect of antivirals can now be studied in human lymphoid tissue under controlled conditions in vitro.\",\"The mechanisms involved in the restriction of the cellular tropism of HIV-1 to cells of primate origin remain to be clearly defined. However, a number of studies have shown that this is determined not only at the level of the cellular receptor(s) or virus entry, but at a number of additional and later stages in virus replication. We have recently reported that the reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA is markedly enhanced by the association of the gag encoded nucleocapsid p15 protein and cellular topoisomerase I. In the present study we have investigated if the recruitment of cellular topoisomerase I during virus replication is important in determining the cellular tropism of HIV-1. Employing a stable murine cell line, L929, expressing both human CD4 and topoisomerase I, it could be demonstrated that effective proviral DNA synthesis occurred following infection. In contrast in cells expressing only human CD4, proviral DNA synthesis was not detected. In addition we have co-expressed fusin, a protein known to act as an accessory factor as the virus entry stage in infection of T cell tropic HIV-1, to support viral entry completely. However no progeny virus could be detected after HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that reverse transcription in vivo is critically dependent on the presence of cellular topoisomerase I, and support the view that involvement of this enzyme is important in HIV-1 replication. Moreover the findings suggest that other factors which remained to be identified, are involved in restricting HIV-1 replication in non-primate cells.\",\"The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1) undergo high rates of variation. Only a few point mutations in the envelope gene are required to switch the tropism of HIV-1 from a growth preference for monocytes to lymphocytes or to acquire lytic properties for rapid killing of infected T4 lymphocytes. Since heterosexual transmission efficiency is high for HIV-1's that are most prevalent in Africa or Asia, but low for HIV-1 B, which dominates in the US and western Europe, we asked whether African and Asian viruses had a particular tropism for cells of the reproductive tract. Langerhans' cells (LC), showed only minimal susceptibility to infection with HIV-1B from the US, but substantially greater sensitivity for infections by HIV-1 E and HIV-1 C, subtypes that predominate in Asia and Africa.\",\"The mechanisms involved in the restriction of the cellular tropism of HIV-1 to cells of primate origin remain to be clearly defined.

Human primary fetal astrocytes, adult lymphocytes, or macrophages were exposed to vitreous in culture and and cells were then assayed for HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification. We found that 11 of 14 patients tested carried ocular HIV-1 which replicated in one or more primary cell types; of the 13 vitreous samples tested in astrocytes, eight contained transmissible HIV-1. The three patients with no culturable ocular virus were in antiviral therapy at the time of vitrectomy. Comparison of envelope V3 sequences from astrocytes infected in culture to that in uncultured blood cells revealed 21% sequence divergence indicating that ocular HIV-1 transmitted to astrocytes was not recently derived from virus present in the blood. Two ocular samples transmissible to astrocytes were tested further and found capable of sustained replication by serial passage to uninfected astrocytes. However, the viral structural proteins produced by infected astrocytes were abnormal, p24 was absent and higher molecular weight Gag proteins were present. We conclude that the eye is a central nervous system compartment which frequently contains HIV-1 capable of replication in human astrocytes.\",\"CD4 is the primary cellular receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but is not sufficient for entry of HIV-1 into cells. After a decade-long search, the cellular coreceptors that HIV-1 requires in conjunction with CD4 have been identified as members of the chemokine receptor family of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors. The discovery of distinct chemokine receptors that support entry of T-cell tropic (CXCR-4) and macrophage tropic HIV-1 strains (CCR-5) explains the differences in cell tropism between viral strains, the inability of HIV-1 to infect most nonprimate cells, and the resistance of a small percentage of the population to HIV-1 infection. Further understanding of the role of chemokine receptors in viral entry may also help explain the evolution of more pathogenic forms of the virus, viral transmission, and HIV-induced pathogenesis. These recent discoveries will aid the development of strategies for combating HIV-1 transmission and spread, the understanding of HIV-1 fusion mechanisms, and the possible development of small animal models for HIV-1 drug and vaccine testing.\",\"The recent identification of the CC-CKR5 beta chemokine receptor as a major cofactor for entry of macrophage-tropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) raises the question of whether macrophage tropism is determined by utilization of this chemokine receptor. We observe that in addition to macrophage-tropic isolates of clades A, B, and E, macrophage-tropic isolates of clade F also utilize the CC-CKR5 molecule for entry. However, using single-round replication-competent reporter viruses carrying the envelope genes of T-cell line-tropic or macrophage-tropic phenotypic recombinant and mutant HIV-1 strains in infection of stable cell lines that coexpress the CD4 and chemokine receptors, we were unable to establish a strict correlation between macrophage tropism and utilization of the CC-CKR5 chemokine receptor. This latter finding suggests that a cofactor other than CC-CKR5 serves to determine entry into primary macrophages.\",\"We previously reported the antiviral capacity of human serum albumin (HSA), which was modified by the introduction of a single (Suc-HSA) or two carboxylic groups (Aco-HSA) per lysine residue, yielding strongly negatively charged polypeptides. Here we report the antiviral effect of these modified HSAs on replication of primary HIV-1 isolates that differed with respect to syncytium-inducing (SI) capacity and cell tropism. Both Suc-HSA and Aco-HSA potently inhibited replication of primary HIV-1 variants, independent of the SI capacity of the HIV-1 variant, with IC50 values in the range of 50 to 187 microg/ml. The inhibition of the formation of syncytia and the absence of proviral DNA products in cells inoculated with HIV-1 in the presence of Suc-HSA or Aco-HSA pointed to interference at an early level in the virus replication cycle. The inhibitory capacity of Suc-HSA and Aco-HSA on primary HIV-1 variants suggests that these agents are potential candidates for use in antiviral therapy in HIV-infected individuals.\",\"The V3 region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein is known to have a major influence on macrophage tropism as well as the ability to cause syncytium formation or fusion in CD4-positive lymphocyte cultures. Using infectious molecular HIV-1 clones, a series of mutant clones was created which allowed detailed mapping of V3 amino acid positions involved in these properties. In these experiments the non-syncytium-inducing phenotype in T cells did not always correlate with macrophage tropism. Macrophage tropism appeared to depend on the presence of certain combinations of amino acids at five specific positions within and just outside of the V3 loop itself, whereas syncytium formation in lymphocytes was influenced by substitution of particular residues at two to four positions within V3. In most cases, different V3 amino acid positions were found to independently influence macrophage tropism and syncytium formation in T cells and position 13 was the only V3 location which appeared to simultaneously influence both macrophage tropism and syncytium formation in lymphocytes.\",\"To assess the disease progression rate among 12 HIV-2-infected West European residents (nine of West African descent), compared with the disease progression rate among HIV-1-infected individuals of the same population, and the characteristics of the HIV-2 strains involved. HIV-2-infected individuals were identified by commercially available serological assays, their clinical status and CD4+ cell counts were monitored, and HIV-2 was isolated from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T-cell-line tropism and syncytium-inducing capacities of the isolated viruses were determined and their phylogenetic relationships were analysed by comparing polymerase chain reaction-amplified nucleotide sequences of reverse transcriptase (RT) gene segments. Eight of the 12 HIV-2-infected individuals presented with progressive disease and one of them progressed from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention group A1 to A3 within 36 months after seroconversion. The ratios of asymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals among residents of the Rotterdam region of West African descent were 2:7 for HIV-2 and 8:9 for HIV-1-infected individuals. HIV-2 was isolated from six of the nine individuals with progressive disease. The time required for virus isolation correlated inversely with the individuals' CD4+ cell counts. Five of the HIV-2 isolates replicated in immortalized T-cell lines, and two isolates from patients with AIDS were syncytium-inducing. Five HIV-2 isolates from patients born in the Cape Verdian Isles grouped together within subtype A. The HIV-2 isolate from a patient of Ghanese origin belonged to subtype B. Mutations were identified in the RT genes from HIV-2 isolates of two zidovudine-treated patients, one of which has also been shown to be involved in zidovudine resistance in HIV-1. Disease progression in HIV-2 infection may be as rapid as in HIV-1. HIV-2 isolation and viral phenotype were related to disease status, and mutations identical to those observed in HIV-1 zidovudine resistance were observed in patients treated with zidovudine.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) belongs to the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses and has several interesting features, including T cell tropism and the ability to infect nondividing cells. Replication-incompetent HIV vectors were developed and were shown to be capable of targeted gene transfer into CD4+T cells. This strict T cell tropism may be important for the development of gene therapy of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but it hampers the use of the HIV vector for other gene transfer applications. To expand the host range of the HIV vector, we established the two-step gene transfer system, which allows us to transduce non-T cells stably. In the first step, the CD4 gene was introduced into target cells using a replication-defective adenoviral vector. Transient but high-level expression of CD4 molecules was detected in both adherent and floating cells. In the subsequent step, the cells were incubated with HIV vectors. Stable integration of the HIV vector was demonstrated in cells transduced with the adenoviral vector. These results indicate that transient expression of CD4 molecules by the adenoviral vector is sufficient to render non-T cells susceptible to HIV-mediated gene transfer. This two-step gene transfer strategy may be used as a general method to transduce various types of human cells stably including nondividing cells.\",\"Twenty-two HIV-1-infected Russian individuals were studied to gain better insight on the genetic and biological characteristics of HIV-1 variants present in Russia. The V3 domain of the HIV-1 envelope was directly sequenced from cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Phylogenetic analyses were used to determine the HIV-1 genetic subtype and to study transmission patterns. Virus isolates were obtained from PBMCs and the biological phenotype was determined by coculture with MT-2, CEM, and Jurkat-tat cells. Twelve homo- and bisexual men carried subtype B variants, whereas 6 heterosexually infected individuals carried subtype F virus. A heterosexual man infected in the Ivory Coast and a nosocomially infected young female carried subtype A and G virus, respectively. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses suggested that subtype B may have entered Russia on at least four occasions and, even more surprisingly, that the relatively rare subtype F has entered Russia on at least three occasions. Two suspected transmission clusters of subtype F were supported by the phylogenetic analyses, whereas one suspected subtype B transmission cluster was not. Positively charged amino acids in positions 311 and 325 of V3 loop have been shown to be important determinants for the MT-2-positive biological phenotype of virus isolates. Interestingly, we found that the direct PBMC sequences from individuals with MT-2-positive isolates displayed specific neutral, instead of positively charged, amino acids, in these positions. This indicates that it may be more difficult to predict the biological phenotype of HIV-1 using sequences from uncultured PBMCs than from virus isolates.\",\"For efficient entry into target cells, primary macrophage-tropic and laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) require particular chemokine receptors, CCR-5 and CXCR-4, respectively, as well as the primary receptor CD4 (refs 1-6). Here we show that a complex of gp120, the exterior envelope glycoprotein, of macrophage-tropic primary HIV-1 and soluble CD4 interacts specifically with CCR-5 and inhibits the binding of the natural CCR-5 ligands, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta (refs 7, 8). The apparent affinity of the interaction between gp120 and CCR-5 was dramatically lower in the absence of soluble CD4. Additionally, in the absence of gp120, an interaction between a two-domain CD4 fragment and CCR-5 was observed. A gp120 fragment retaining the CD4-binding site and overlapping epitopes was able to interact with CCR-5 only if the V3 loop, which can specify HIV-1 tropism and chemokine receptor choice, was also present on the molecule. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either CD4-induced or V3 epitopes on gp120 blocked the interaction of gp12O-CD4 complexes with CCR-5. These results suggest that HIV-1 attachment to CD4 creates a high-affinity binding site for CCR-5, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry.\",\"Biological and genetic variability is a prominent feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains, especially in tropism, syncytium formation, and replicative capacity. To determine whether there were variable host cell effects on HIV replication in monocytes, three different strains of low-passage-number monocytotropic blood isolates of HIV and the laboratory-adapted strain Ba-L were inoculated into panels of adherent monocytes drawn from 44 different donors, and peak extracellular HIV p24 antigen titers were compared. The clinical HIV strains showed patterns of either moderate or low-level replication in most donor monocytes (20 to 4,000 pg/ml). However, within this range there was marked variation in peak titers in most donors. HIV type 1 Ba-L replicated in all donor monocytes to much higher levels with less variability (30 to 40 ng/ml). Furthermore, replication of 21 clinical blood-derived strains of HIV in blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from pairs of identical twins and age-matched unrelated donors (URD) of the same sex were compared. In all of the seven pairs of identical twins, the kinetics of replication (measured by extracellular HIV p24 antigen) of panels of four clinical HIV type 1 isolates in monocytes were similar within pairs. However, marked and significant differences in kinetics of HIV production occurred within 10 of the 12 unrelated donor pairs (P = 0.0007). The remaining two URD pairs showed similar kinetic patterns, but only one pair had the same HLA-DR genotype. Similar results were observed with monocytes/MDMs obtained from a second bleed of the same donor. Hence, discordant patterns of HIV replication kinetics between URD monocyte pairs contrasted with concordant patterns in identical twin monocytes. These data strongly suggest a host cell genetic effect on productive viral replication in monocytes and MDMs. So far, no consistent genetic linkage of HIV replication pattern with HLA-DR genotype has been observed.\",\"To ascertain whether viruses present at the time of primary viremia can infect the central nervous system and to determine if microglial tropism is distinct from tropism for monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), 27 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates obtained from acutely infected individuals, as well as laboratory strains, were assayed for their ability to replicate in primary adult microglial cultures and in MDM. Most of the isolates replicated equally well in both microglia and MDM, but several isolates replicated preferentially in one of the two cell types, differing by as much as 40-fold in p24gag production. This indicated that while MDM and microglial tropism overlap, a subset of isolates is particularly tropic for one of the two cell types. One isolate was further adapted to microglia by 15 sequential passages, raising the peak p24 concentration produced by 1,000-fold. In addition, the passaged virus induced marked cytopathologic changes (vacuolization and syncytium formation) in infected microglial cultures. Sequence comparison of the V3 loop of unpassaged and multiply passaged virus revealed amino acid changes shown to be associated with isolates from patients with HIV dementia. Our data support the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection can be established in the central nervous system by viruses present early in HIV infection, that some of these viruses are particularly tropic for microglia, and that adaptation in this cell type can result in the selection of a pool of predominantly microglia-tropic (neurotropic) viruses.\",\"A recombinant rabies virus (RV) mutant deficient for the surface spike glycoprotein (G) gene was used to study the incorporation of envelope proteins from HIV-1 expressed from transfected plasmids. A hybrid HIV-1 protein in which the cytoplasmic domain was replaced with that of RV G was incorporated into the virus envelope and rescued the infectivity of the RV mutant. The RV(HIV-1) pseudotype viruses could infect only CD4+ cells, and their infectivity was neutralized specifically by anti-HIV-1 sera. In contrast to the chimeric protein, wild-type HIV-1 envelope protein or mutants with truncated cytoplasmic domains failed to produce pseudotyped particles. This indicates the presence of a specific signal in the RV G cytoplasmic domain, allowing correct incorporation of a spike protein into the envelope of rhabdovirus particles. The possibility of directing the cell tropism of RV by replacement of the RV G with proteins of defined receptor specificity should prove useful for future development of targetable gene delivery vectors.\",\"Although lymphocytes expressing the CD4 surface receptor for HIV-1 have been identified as the principal target of the virus, the extent to which infection of other cell types of the immune system contributes to immunodeficiency is unknown. We investigated the cell types in peripheral blood infected with HIV and the relation of viral load in different subsets to disease progression. The study group consisted of 16 HIV-infected individuals, eight of whom had clinically defined AIDS with CD4 cell counts less than 200/microL blood. The main component subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified by magnetic bead separation, and included CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells. HIV proviral sequences within these separate populations were quantified by limiting-dilution nested polymerase chain reaction. HIV-1 proviral sequences were detected in T-helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes. CD4 T lymphocytes constituted the main reservoir of HIV in all but one of the symptom-free individuals studied (those with CD4 count > 200/microL). However, in all the individuals with CD4 counts of less than 200/microL, most infected cells within the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction were either dendritic cells or CD8 lymphocytes. Infection of CD8 cells accounted for between 66% and 97% of total proviral load in five of the eight AIDS patients. A strong inverse relation between total CD8 count and the frequency of CD8 T-lymphocyte infection was found. This study provides evidence for widespread infection of lymphocytes of the CD8 phenotype, indicating that HIV-1 has a broader tropism for different cell types in vivo than described for cultured virus. Infection of CD8 cells may contribute to the decline of this subset upon disease progression in HIV-infected individuals. Infection of CD8 cells may or may not occur by a non-CD4-dependent mechanism of virus entry.\",\"The identification of the cofactors required for HIV-1 entry into cells promises to provide new insights into viral transmission and pathogenesis, and opens new avenues for AIDS therapy and prophylaxis.\",\"Previous studies of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion have focused on laboratory-adapted T-lymphotropic strains of the virus. The goal of this study was to characterize membrane fusion mediated by a primary HIV-1 isolate in comparison with a laboratory-adapted strain. To this end, a new fusion assay was developed on the basis of the principle of resonance energy transfer, using HeLa cells stably transfected with gp120/gp41 from the T-lymphotropic isolate HIV-1LA1 or the macrophage-tropic primary isolate HIV-1JR-FL. These cells fused with CD4+ target cell lines with a tropism mirroring that of infection by the two viruses. Of particular note, HeLa cells expressing HIV-1JR-FL gp120/gp41 fused only with PM1 cells, a clonal derivative of HUT 78, and not with other T-cell or macrophage cell lines. These results demonstrate that the envelope glycoproteins of these strains play a major role in mediating viral tropism. Despite significant differences exhibited by HIV-1JR-FL and HIV-1LAI in terms of tropism and sensitivity to neutralization by CD4-based proteins, the present study found that membrane fusion mediated by the envelope glycoproteins of these viruses had remarkably similar properties. In particular, the degree and kinetics of membrane fusion were similar, fusion occurred at neutral pH and was dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Inhibition of HIV-1JR-FL envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion by soluble CD4 and CD4-IgG2 occurred at concentrations similar to those required to neutralize this virus. Interestingly, higher concentrations of these agents were required to inhibit HIV-1LAI envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion, in contrast to the greater sensitivity of HIV-1LAI virions to neutralization by soluble CD4 and CD4-IgG2. This finding suggests that the mechanisms of fusion inhibition and neutralization of HIV-1 are distinct.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) specifically incorporates the host cell peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin A into virions via contacts with the capsid (CA) domain of the Gag polyprotein Pr55gag. The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A and the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin A analog SDZ NIM 811 bind to cyclophilin A and inhibit its incorporation into HIV-1 virions. Both drugs inhibit the virion association of cyclophilin A and the replication of HIV-1 with a similar dose dependence. In contrast, these compounds are inactive against other primate lentiviruses which do not incorporate cyclophilin A, such as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). To locate determinants which confer sensitivity to SDZ NIM 811, we generated chimeric proviruses between HIV-1 and SIVmac. A hybrid SIVmac which has the CA-p2 domain of the Gag polyprotein replaced by the corresponding domain from HIV-1 replicated in an established CD4+ cell line and in human but not macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The transfer of the HIV-1 CA-p2 domain to SIVmac led to the efficient incorporation of cyclophilin A, and SDZ NIM 811 effectively inhibited both the virion association of cyclophilin A and the spread of the hybrid virus in infected cultures. We conclude that the HIV-1 CA-p2 domain contains determinants which confer the necessity to interact with cyclophilin A for efficient virus replication. Furthermore, our data show that the CA-p2 domain can play a crucial role in species tropism.\",\"Two proviral HIV transgenic mouse models, one bearing wild-type HIV proviral DNA and the other a modified provirus in which the viral LTRs contained the core enhancer of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), were compared. The MLV/HIV chimeric LTR, in which the MLV enhancer replaced the NF-kappa B-binding motifs, was transcriptionally active in human and murine cells in vitro and virus containing the chimeric LTR was replication competent in human cell cultures. Transgenic mice derived from microinjections of chimeric MLV/HIV proviral DNA transcribed HIV genes at a greater frequency and at higher levels than wild-type HIV proviral transgenic mice. MLV/HIV mice were also more apt to develop disease; wasting, periocular infections, and a degenerative myopathy characterized the most predominant phenotype. The tissue specificities of the wild-type and chimeric LTRs in transgenic mice were remarkably similar, but a significant difference was apparent in lymphoid cells. Basal level and LPS-inducible HIV gene expression occurred in peritoneal and bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild-type HIV transgenic mice. In contrast, HIV gene expression in macrophages from MLV/HIV mice was undetectable, even following LPS induction. However, cultured splenocytes from MLV/HIV mice supported HIV proviral gene transcription better than splenocytes from HIV mice, particularly after induction with LPS or anti-IgD antibody but not with concanavalin A. These data suggest that in transgenic mice, the HIV and MLV/HIV LTRs display a differential tropism for macrophages and B cells, respectively. HIV and MLV/HIV transgenic mice represent alternative models amenable to in vivo studies of HIV gene regulation in lymphoid cells, the induction of HIV-related disease and the evaluation of anti-HIV therapies.\",\"Work in this laboratory previously demonstrated that the tropism of different human immunodeficiency type 1 isolates for infection of human CD4+ continuous cell lines (e.g., T-cell lines and HeLa-CD4 transformants) versus primary macrophages is associated with parallel intrinsic fusogenic specificities of the corresponding envelope glycoproteins (Envs). For T-cell line-tropic isolates, it is well established that the target cell must also contain a human-specific fusion cofactor(s) whose identity is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the Env fusion specificities underlying T-cell line versus macrophage tropism are determined by distinct cell type-specific fusion cofactors. We applied a recombinant vaccinia virus-based reporter gene assay for Env-CD4-mediated cell fusion; the LAV and Ba-L Envs served as prototypes for T-cell line-tropic and macrophage-tropic isolates, respectively. We examined CD4+ promyeloctic and monocytic cell lines that are infectible by T-cell line-tropic isolates and become susceptible to macrophage-tropic strains only after treatment with differentiating agents. We observed parallel changes in fusion specificity: untreated cells supported fusion by the LAV but not the Ba-L Env, whereas cells treated with differentiating agents acquired fusion competence for Ba-L. These results suggest that in untreated cells, the block to infection by macrophage-tropic isolates is at the level of membrane fusion; furthermore, the differential regulation of fusion permissiveness for the two classes of Envs is consistent with the existence of distinct fusion cofactors. To test this notion directly, we conducted experiments with transient cell hybrids formed between CD4-expressing nonhuman cells (murine NIH 3T3) and different human cell types. Hybrids formed with HeLa cells supported fusion by the LAV Env but not by the Ba-L Env, whereas hybrids formed with primary macrophages showed the opposite specificity; hybrids formed between HeLa cells and macrophages supported fusion by both Envs. These results suggest the existence of cell type-specific fusion cofactors selective for each type of Env, rather than fusion inhibitors for discordant Env-cell combinations. Finally, analyses based on recombinant protein expression and antibody blocking did not support the proposals by others that the CD44 or CD26 antigens are involved directly in the entry of macrophage-tropic isolates.\",\"NaN\",\"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a proteinase which activates plasminogen by cleaving at -CPGR(arrow downward)V-, was shown to cleave the V3 loop in recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IIIB and MN strains, as well as a synthetic, cyclized peptide representing the clade B consensus sequence of V3. Proteolysis occurred at the homologous -GPGR(arrow downward)A-, an important neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. It required soluble CD4 and was prevented by inhibitors of uPA but not by inhibitors of likely contaminating plasma proteinases. It was accelerated by heparin, a known cofactor for plasminogen activation. In immune capture experiments, tight binding of uPA to viral particles, which did not depend on CD4, was also demonstrated. Active site-directed inhibitors or uPA diminished this binding, as did a neutralizing antibody to V3. Addition of exogenous uPA to the laboratory-adapted IIIB strain of HIV-1, the macrophage-tropic field strains JR-CSF and SF-162, or a fresh patient isolate of indeterminate tropism, followed by infection of macrophages with the various treated viruses, resulted in severalfold increases in subsequent viral replication, as judged by yields of reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen, as well as incorporation, as judged by PCR in situ. These responses were reversible by inhibitors or antibodies targeting the proteinase active site or the V3 loop. We propose that uPA, a transcriptionally regulated proteinase which is upregulated when macrophages are HIV infected, can be bound and utilized by the virus to aid in fusion and may be an endogenous component that is critical to the infection of macrophages by HIV-1.\",\"We examined the ability of chemokine receptors and related G protein-coupled receptors to facilitate infection by primary, clinical HIV-1 isolates. CCR5, when expressed along with CD4, the HIV-1 receptor, allowed cell lines resistant to most primary HIV-1 isolates to be infected. CCR3 facilitated infection by a more restricted subset of primary viruses, and binding of the CCR3 ligand, eotaxin, inhibited infection by these isolates. Utilization of CCR3 and CCR5 on the target cell depended upon the sequence of the third variable (V3) region of the HIV-1 gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein. The ability of various members of the chemokine receptor family to support the early stages of HIV-1 infection helps to explain viral tropism and beta-chemokine inhibition of primary HIV-1 isolates.\",\"We constructed a number of HXB2 viruses chimeric for the gp 120 glycoprotein derived from a number of viable molecular clones obtained from a primary isolate. Comparative biological characterization of the parental primary viruses with the gp 120.HXB2 chimeras demonstrated identical patterns of cell tropism and cytopathicity. Furthermore, both parental and chimeric viruses were insensitive to neutralization by sCD4 and a panel of conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that transfer of the gp 120 protein alone was sufficient to confer a \\\"neutralization-resistant\\\" phenotype to the T-cell-adapted clone HXB2. We assessed the contribution of gp 120 epitopes to the neutralizing immune response by comparing the sensitivity of these viruses to neutralization by a panel of sera from HIV-infected individuals. Seven of eleven sera tested were able to neutralize HXB2 and two or more of the chimeric viruses; in contrast, only one serum neutralized more than one of the parental primary virus clones. The association of gp 120-gp41 envelope at the surface of infected PBMC cultures was measured in the presence or absence of soluble CD4. No differences in CD4-induced gp 120 dissociation were seen between the chimeric and parental virus-infected cultures. Since gp 120 conformation appeared the same between primary and chimeric viruses, we suggest that the ability of human sera to neutralize the chimeric viruses may be mediated by epitopes within gp41.\",\"The level of proviral DNA sequence variation in the V1V2 region was monitored over time in six HIV-1-infected individuals. Substitutional and length variation was observed, where the majority of length changes, ranging from 28 to 49 amino acids, was located within the V1 region. Evidence for convergent evolution in the V2 region was found. The functional significance of this variation was assessed by cloning the V1V2 sequences into an infectious molecular clone, HXB2. The majority of chimeras replicated, demonstrating that the sequences, though genetically distinct, were capable of conferring a viable phenotype. Chimeras expressing closely related sequences in a constant genetic background displayed different biological phenotypes, with respect to both cytopathicity and cell tropism. However, no association between primary V1V2 amino acid sequence and viability or cytopathicity of the chimeric virus was observed, suggesting that predictions of virus phenotype based on sequences alone may be incorrect. The effect of V1V2 variation on the overall gp 120 conformation was measured by expressing the gp 20 from a number of viable and nonviable clones. No differences were observed, suggesting that misfolding of the chimeric gp 120 protein was not an explanation for the nonviability of some virus clones. Several chimeras were noncytopathic and only able to replicate in PBMC cultures, demonstrating that the V1V2 region, independent of the V3 sequence, is capable of defining both tropism and cytopathicity.\",\"Understanding the interaction between HIV and developing thymocytes is crucial in determining how HIV infection perturbs the immune system. We determined which thymocyte subsets can harbor and express HIV. HIV expression in mature and immature thymocytes obtained from surgical specimens from non-infected children was determined after in vitro infection with the syncytium-inducing, cytopathic NL4-3 and the non-syncytium-inducing, relatively noncytopathic JR-CSF isolates. Intracellular staining for the HIV p24gag antigen was combined with cell surface phenotyping to determine thymocyte subsets expressing HIV. Infection was quantitated by polymerase chain reaction on sorted subsets. NL4-3 replicated faster and to higher titers and caused a more severe decrease of all CD4-bearing thymocytes than did JR-CSF. In addition, both immature CD1+ and mature CD1-thymocytes expressed NL4-3, whereas only mature CD1-cells expressed JR-CSF. The tropism of NL4-3 for these immature cells suggests a mechanism for a more profound impact on T-cell maturation than that seen with JR-CSF. We also found that thymocytes lacking cell surface CD4 (CD4-CD8- and CD4-CD8+ subsets) expressed virus with either isolate late in infection, when viral levels were high. The CD4-CD8- cells expressing HIV were mature CD3bright T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta bright cells. These results show that NL4-3 can be expressed by thymocytes at immature and mature stages of differentiation and cause severe loss of CD4+ cells. Thus, tropism of a virus for immature cells can affect the capability of the thymus to produce new T lymphocytes leading to a greater impact on development and functions of the immune system. It is proposed that this in vitro model can be used to study pathogenic mechanisms in the thymus.\",\"We sought to determine the clinical significance of macrophage tropic and non-syncytium inducing isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with and without AIDS dementia complex (ADC). HIV-1 was isolated from the CSF of 31 patients with and without ADC. The isolates were then characterised as to the degree of macrophage tropism by quantitation of p24 production and the presence of syncytium inducing (SI) or non-syncytium inducing (NSI) isolates by MT2 assay and SupT1 coculture. The degree of macrophage tropism varied according to the donor macrophage that was used except in strongly macrophage tropic isolates. Moderate and severe ADC (stage > or = 2) was associated with the presence of highly macrophage tropic isolates in the CSF (P = 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity values of a highly macrophage tropic isolate in the CSF for ADC stage > or = 2 were 82% and 66% respectively while the predictive value was 64%. Three of four asymptomatic patients with such highly macrophage tropic isolates in the CSF subsequently developed ADC after an average of 4 months. Twenty-eight isolates from the CSF and 23 from the blood were NSI regardless of the presence or absence of ADC. The predictive value of an SI isolate in the blood reflecting an SI isolate in the CSF was 37.5% while the predictive value of an NSI isolate in the blood reflecting an NSI in the CSF was 100%. These data suggest that host factors are essential in determining the degree of macrophage tropism in HIV-1 and that such tropism is important for the presence and possibly subsequent development of ADC. The CSF usually has NSI isolates regardless of the presence of ADC and irrespective of the presence of such isolates in the blood thereby suggesting that the CSF is behaving virologically as a separate compartment to the blood.\",\"We have used envelope recombinant viruses generated between two molecular clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), T-cell-tropic HIV-1SF2 and macrophage-tropic HIV-1SF162, to assess pathogenic potential in the human peripheral blood leukocyte-reconstituted severe combined immune deficiency mouse model. Recombinant HIV-1SF2 viruses expressing the envelope gp120 gene of HIV-ISF162 caused as rapid a CD4+ T-cell depletion as did HIV-1SF162. The reciprocal HIV-1SF162 recombinant virus with the HIV-1SF2 envelope caused slower CD4+ T-cell loss. Although changing the V3 loop sequence of HIV-1SF162 to that of HIV-1SF2 did not change the rate of CD4+ T-cell depletion, replacing the V3 of HIV-1SF2 with the sequence of HIV-1SF162 resulted in virus that was poorly infectious in vivo but not in vitro. These studies suggest that the envelope gene determines properties important for pathogenesis in vivo as well as for cell tropism in vitro. HIV-1 infection in vivo may have more stringent requirements for envelope conformation.\",\"Two infectious molecular clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, NL4-3 and JR-CSF, differ in their abilities to productively infect human brain capillary endothelial (HBCE) cells. The phenotypes of recombinants between these two molecular strains were examined to identify viral sequences responsible for the difference in HBCE cell tropism between the two parental strains. Our results indicate that HBCE cell tropism maps to a region that encompasses the C1 region of env and includes overlapping reading frames for the accessory genes vpr, vpu, tat, and rev. This region was unique for HBCE cell tropism and did not cosegregate with either macrophage or T-cell line tropism. However, several recombinant clones displayed dual tropism for both HBCE cells and macrophages. These endothelial cell- and macrophage-tropic strains may have a unique pathogenic advantage by entering the brain via HBCE cells and subsequently infecting microglial cells with high efficiency, leading to the induction of human immunodeficiency virus dementia.\",\"The emergence of syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 isolates in infected individuals precedes an accelerated CD4+ T cell decline and is associated with high virus load and rapid disease progression. The exact mechanism by which SI HIV-1 variants may cause this enhanced clinical progression is unknown. Here we demonstrate that an SI HIV-1 isolate had a broader tropism for CD4+ T cell clones (TCC) compared to a macrophage-tropic non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) HIV-1 isolate. Whereas the NSI isolate replicated poorly in 6 of 12 TCC and completely failed to replicate in 3 of 12 TCC, the SI isolate replicated efficiently in all 12 TCC tested. Restriction for replication occurred early in the viral replication cycle, before provirus formation. Infection of TCC with the SI but not with the NSI HIV-1 isolate resulted in massive death of T cells, independent of the extent of virus replication and proportion of infected cells. The high cytopathicity and broader tropism of the SI isolate for primary CD4+ T cells may be directly related to the increased rate of CD4 cell decline and rapid disease progression in carriers of SI variants.\",\"The most frequent neurological complication of AIDS is a dementia-like syndrome. Power and collaborators (J Virol 1994; 68:4643-4649) have reported an association between the clinical signs of AIDS dementia and the amino acid composition of two positions (305 and 329) within the V3 region of HIV-1 strains amplified from brain tissue. Similarly, we analyzed position 305 in the V3 region of HIV-1 present in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid of 25 nondemented subjects at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection. Our results are, however, at variance with the findings presented by Power and colleagues. Histidine, found to be common among sequences derived from demented patients, was also present in the majority (16 of 25) of nondemented patients analyzed by us. In the hands of Power and colleagues, sequences derived from nondemented patients contained proline at position 305. None of our patients had proline in this position. We also asked the question whether the presence of a specific amino acid at position 305 of the V3 loop is linked to an increased capacity of HIV-1 isolates to infect primary microglial cells, the major target cell for HIV-1 infection in the brain. Primary HIV-1 isolates derived from blood and cerebrospinal fluid of five patients, two asymptomatic and three AIDS patients, were used to infect microglia cell cultures. Infection was monitored by syncytium formation and by p24 antigen release in the culture supernatant. All but one of the paired blood/CSF isolates replicated in human brain cultures. Replication occurred independently from the amino acid present at position 305 of the V3 region of the viral envelope. Our results indicate that the majority of HIV-1 isolates, even derived during the asymptomatic stage, have the capacity to infect microglial cells. The relevance of viral envelope sequences in determining tropism for microglial cells and development of neurological symptoms remains an open question.\",\"Haematological abnormalities are often seen in patients infected with HIV. A number of mechanisms are thought to contribute to this bone marrow suppression, including impaired stromal function and direct infection of progenitor cells. Evidence suggests that both bone marrow progenitor cells and perhaps stromal cells are open to infection by HIV, which raises the possibility that bone marrow stromal cells may serve as a reservoir for HIV. This study investigated the cellular targets and kinetics of in vitro infection of stroma in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) using both mono- and lymphocytotropic strains of HIV-1. p24 ELISA and reverse transcriptase (RT) assay demonstrated that stroma could be infected with HIV and release infectious virions. The target cells for infection were shown to be macrophages by immunohistochemistry (APAAP), dual immunofluorescence staining (using CD68 and p24) and electron microscopy. The data show that it was possible to infect stroma in LTBMC with HIV and that such infection was productive. The main target for infection was bone marrow macrophages. In contrast to peripheral blood derived macrophages, these cells were susceptible to both lymphocytotropic and monocytotropic strains of HIV-1. The data suggests that these bone marrow macrophages may act as a reservoir for HIV, Infection of bone marrow macrophages may affect haemopoiesis either by transmission of HIV infection to developing progenitor cells through direct cell-to-cell contact or by altering the ability of the stroma to support normal development.\",\"NaN\",\"Some neuronal-derived CD4-negative cells are susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Galactosyl ceramide is an alternate receptor for HIV-1 that appears to bind in vitro to the C2, V3, V4, and V5 regions of gp120. Amino acid variation in the V3 loop of HIV-1 affects cellular tropism in CD4-positive cells, but its effect on CD4-negative cells has not been fully analyzed. Here, we describe the effect of amino acid changes in V3 on the HIV-1 infection of a CD4-negative neuronal cell line, SK-N-MC. The sequence of the V3 domain was found to dramatically alter virus infectivity. Furthermore, a gp120 V3 loop neutralizing monoclonal antibody blocked HIV-1 infection of SK-N-MC cells. This data suggests that V3 may also serve as a primary viral determinant for infectivity of CD4-negative cells.\",\"Serum samples collected since 1989 with various patterns of reactivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, on the basis of screening ELISA and confirmatory Western blot (WB) test, were subjected to the detection of HIV-2 infection based on screening dot immunoassay and confirmatory WB for HIV-2. Significant prevalence of HIV-2 infection was (37.03%) among sera reactive for HIV-1 by ELISA but indeterminate by Western blot, compared with sera reactive for HIV-1 by ELISA and WB (3.29%) or negative by WB (2.63%). Out of 16 HIV-2 positive sera, 5 (31.25%) showed evidence of concomitant HIV-1 infection. This study demonstrates evidence of HIV-2 infection as early as 1989, earlier than reported so far from India.\",\"Heterosexual transmission by vaginal intercourse accounts for most transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) in Africa and Asia but is less important in the HIV-1 epidemics of the United States and Western Europe. Epithelial Langerhans' cells (LCs) represent a possible source of initial cell contact for vaginal infection. Fifteen primary isolates of HIV-1 from U.S. homosexuals and 18 HIV-1 isolates from Thailand heterosexuals were evaluated for growth in LCs of U.S. origin. All the viruses from the Thai heterosexuals, which were subtype E, grew more efficiently in the LCs than any of the viruses from the U.S. homosexuals, which are subtype B. These results suggest that LC tropism is associated with the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV.\",\"NaN\",\"Although the V3 loop of the envelope glycoprotein (gp120) plays a role in determining the phenotype, pathogenesis, and tropism of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), there has not been any consistent correlation between structure and phenotype. Theoretically determined structures of the V3 loop of gp120, from 20 different viral strains, 10 syncytium-inducing (SI) and 10 non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype, revealed that all V3 loops from SI phenotypic strains had at least two positively charged residues in close proximity, on the same face of the loop. All of the SI phenotypic V3 loop structures were capable of forming strong divalent electrostatic interactions with disulfated sugars. The ability to form this interaction may be a determinant of the phenotype, tropism, and pathogenicity of HIV-1 viral strains. This structural motif was absent in all V3 loops from viral strains with the NSI phenotype.\",\"It is well recognized clinically that herpesviruses can cause disease in AIDS patients once human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has precipitated marked immunosuppression. However, in addition to this opportunistic relationship, there is evidence to suggest that herpesviruses could increase the pathogenicity of HIV by acting as cofactors. Experiments in vitro have shown that several herpesviruses can activate HIV gene expression or alter the cellular tropism of HIV through a variety of mechanisms (antigen presentation, cytokine release, pseudotype formation, CD4 cell surface upregulation, Fc receptor formation, transactivation). Studies of human autopsy material have shown that some herpesviruses (particularly cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6 and herpes simplex virus) are found frequently in AIDS patients. If such herpesviruses act as cofactors in vivo, then their inhibition by aciclovir could explain why a survival benefit has been reported from the use of this drug in two double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials.\",\"The objective of this paper is the isolation and biological characterization of HIV-1 from patients at different clinical status of the disease. Clinical, epidemiological and virological aspects of 54 infected people were studied. Isolate HIV-1 strains were characterized and classified in relation with replication kinetics and cellular tropism as well as syncytium inducing (SI), and non syncytium inducing (NSI) capacity. The biological phenotype of viral isolates was correlated with the clinical status of each patient. HIV was isolated from 92.8% AIDS patients and 46.1% asymptomatic seropositive patients, 12 out of 26 strains of AIDS patients were classified rapid high (RH) and SI, however 2 out of 12 strains of asymptomatic seropositive carriers were considered similar too. The percentage of recovered viral isolates correlates with the patient's clinical status, and the association existing between the isolate biological phenotype and the clinical status of the infection in most of the cases, but not in all was demonstrated.\",\"We examined the relationship between the amino acid sequences of the V2 and V3 regions of the envelope protein and the biological properties of ten human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primary isolates. The infectivity, cytopathic effect (CPE), and syncytium forming activity of these primary isolates were tested against three T cell lines (CEM, MT2, and MOLT4/CL.8 cells), CD8-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from seronegative donors. In addition to the viral groups which had the syncytium inducing/T-cell line tropic (SI/TT) phenotype or non-syncytium inducing/non-T cell line tropic (NSI/NT) phenotype (including the NSI/macrophage tropic (NSI/MT) phenotype), there was a group of viruses that infected one or two T cell lines and PBMC but could not mediate syncytium formation. We therefore classified this group of viruses as a non-syncytium inducing/partial T-cell line tropic (NSI/pTT) virus. To investigate the relationship between these viral phenotypes and the sequence variability of the V2 and V3 regions of the envelope, we cloned the viral gene segment and sequenced the individual isolates. The sequence data suggested that the SI/TT type changes in the V3 sequence alone mediate a partial T cell line tropism and mild cytopathic effect and that an isolate became more virulent (SI/TT phenotype) if there were additional changes in the V2 or other regions. On the other hand, sequence changes in the V2 region alone could not mediate phenotypic changes but some additional changes in the other variable regions (for example, V3) might be required for the phenotypic changes in combination with changes in V2. These findings also suggested that amino acid changes in both the V2 and V3 region are required for the development of virulent variants of HIV-1 that outgrow during advanced stages of the disease.\",\"We sought to determine whether the neurotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN) was produced by macrophages or lymphocytes infected with isolates of HIV-1 with varying degrees of macrophage tropism derived from patients with varying stages of AIDS dementia complex (ADC). Highly macrophage tropic isolates and minimally macrophage tropic isolates were used to inoculate macrophages and QUIN production was measured. Similarly, QUIN production from macrophages was monitored using a purified cell free highly macrophage tropic isolate and laboratory isolates SF33 and SF2. Each of these experiments was also performed with lymphocytes. We found that macrophages infected with macrophage tropic isolates of HIV-1 led to QUIN production while lymphocytes did not produce QUIN. The ability of the HIV-1 infected macrophages to produce QUIN was related to the viral inoculum and the degree of macrophage tropism of the isolate. The severity of ADC in the patient from whom a particular isolate was derived was not per se a determining factor for QUIN production. Purified cell free ADC isolates also led to QUIN production by macrophages thereby suggesting that HIV-1 infection alone is capable of inducing QUIN production.\",\"Previous studies have suggested that the abilities of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to infect primary macrophages and transformed T cell lines are mutually exclusive and define an important biological distinction among HIV-1 strains. In a survey of eight macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains and nine T cell lines, all frequently used in studies of tropism, we have found that six virus strains replicate in one or more T cell lines and that four T cell lines are highly susceptible to macrophage-tropic HIV-1. Passage through T cell lines did not affect the tropism or the env V3 sequence of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains. We conclude that HIV-1 replication in transformed T cells and primary macrophages are not mutually exclusive, and that as such, these definitions of tropism per se are not generally useful markers for other biological properties of HIV-1.\",\"Vascular endothelial cells (EC) play a key role in viral tropism in vivo. Since conflicting reports have been published on the capability of HIV to infect EC in vitro, we analyzed some factors potentially capable of influencing the susceptibility of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to HIV-1. Both primary cultures and differentiated immortalized HUVEC lines were used. HUVEC were negative for the expression of CD4, but weakly CD26- and galactosylceramide-positive. Although binding of HIV to EC was substantial, the virus was apparently incapable of replicating in nonproliferating cultures. In resting cultures, the content of cell-associated HIV disappeared 4-6 days after infection without production of p24 and infectious progency. In contrast, infection of proliferating EC cultures led to the transient release of p24 and infectious virus (10(2.5)-10(3.5) SFU/ml) peaking 2-6 days postinfection. Antibody neutralization of cytokines that may be produced by EC (IL1, IL6, IL8, TNF, IFN-beta) failed to modify virus adsorption and replication, whereas treatment with IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha stimulated both virus binding and virus release. As seen by gag polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the viral genome persisted up to 15 days in untreated EC cultures, but over 20 days in cultures exposed to IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha. This study shows that: (a) CD4-negative HUVEC are capable of binding substantial amounts of HIV-1; (b) binding is enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines; (c) the establishment of productive infection is favored by cell proliferation; and (d) exposure to IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha enhances virus replication.\",\"Human T lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II), originally isolated in 1982 from a patient with a \\\"T hairy cell leukemia\\\", has not yet been proven to be the causative agent of any specific hematological disease. In order to screen for such an event, and because HTLV-II has a preferential tropism for OKT8 (CD8) T cells (both in vivo and in vitro), we searched for the presence of HTLV-II in lymphoproliferative diseases (LP) of CD8+ T cells. We report a serological and/or molecular study of 169 patients with a T CD8 LP, including 76 patients with malignant or reactive T CD8 LP (34 lymphomas, 27 large granular leukemias, three prolymphocytic leukemias, one hairy cell leukemia, 11 reactive T CD8 LP) and 93 HIV-1+ patients with a T CD8 peripheral lymphocytosis ( > 1500/mm3) from a prospective HIV cohort involving 1264 individuals. In the first series, the 40 sera available were all HTLV-I/II negative, except a 67-year-old French Guyanan man, with a cutaneous large T CD8 cell lymphoma, HTLV-I+. Furthermore, the molecular analysis of the 69 available DNA samples by PCR failed to detect any proviral HTLV-I/II sequences, except for the HTLV-I+ patient. The serological study of the 93 HIV-1+ individuals with CD8 lymphocytosis, showed that three patients were HTLV-I+, but none was HTLV-II+. Thus, in contrast to HTLV-I, whose etiological role in adult T cell leukemia is now well established, there is neither epidemiological nor molecular evidence that prototypic HTLV-II may be etiologically associated specifically with any of the CD8+ T cell LP investigated in this report.\",\"Primate lentiviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) are phenotypically diverse, and virus isolates vary in cytopathicity, replication rate, and cell tropism. While all virus isolates infect primary peripheral blood lymphocytes, only a subset of strains infect established CD4-expressing T-cell lines. Here, we describe the development and characterization of a macaque cell line that can be infected by all of the strains of SIV that we have tested, including macrophage- and T-cell-tropic strains, primary and cell-line adapted strains, and SIVmac, SIVMne, and SIVsm isolates. The cells can be infected by strains of HIV type 2 (HIV-2) to varying degrees, but not by either cloned or primary isolates of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). This cell line is a derivative of a rhesus macaque mammary tumor cell line (CMMT) engineered to express human CD4. For these studies, a CMMT-CD4 clone expressing an integrated copy of a truncated HIV-1 long terminal repeat fused to the beta-galactosidase gene (LTR-beta-gal) was established to allow detection of infectious SIV after a single round of replication. Here, we demonstrate the ability of the CMMT-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cell line to rapidly and quantitatively detect infectious SIV. Using these cells to assay virus, we could readily measure neutralizing antibody activity in animals infected with different SIV isolates. Neutralizing activity was detected against the homologous virus and lower, but detectable, activity was measured against heterologous virus. Thus, this system, which is highly sensitive and can detect infection by all of the SIV isolates we tested, is a rapid method for detecting infectious virus and quantitating neutralizing antibody activity.\",\"V3 loop sequences were compared from 5 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients over time. Three patients remained asymptomatic and 2 became symptomatic with large decrease in CD4 cell counts. The patient isolates were previously evaluated for phenotypic and antigenic properties and had different sensitivities to serum neutralization and changes in phenotype. This study showed a number of amino acid changes for the 2 symptomatic patients, each of whom progressed to AIDS during the study. The only amino acid substitution consistently associated with reduced CD4 cell counts, cytopathic effect, and progression to AIDS was Arg at position 11. Specific amino acid changes could not be correlated with increasing serum neutralization resistance or cytotropism changes. Increased loop charge was associated with a switch from macrophage to T cell tropism and a decrease in the number of CD4 cells. The study shows the importance of naturally occurring mutations in the V3 loop in controlling the biologic properties of HIV-1.\",\"The V3 hypervariable region of the HIV-1 envelope protein is a major determinant of viral tropism for macrophages. However, the replication of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains varies considerably in macrophages, and this variability has been linked to the V1 and V2 envelope regions. In the present study, recombinant HIV clones were generated by inserting V1 and V2 sequences from the Ba-L HIV isolate, which has a high macrophage replication level, into the genomic background of a macrophage-tropic clone with a low macrophage replication level. Infection of macrophages with varying multiplicities of infection and direct detection of the number of infected macrophages per culture showed that the Ba-L V1 and V2 envelope sequences enhanced the ability of virus to spread in the cultures. In contrast, macrophage-tropic clones with low replication efficiency infected macrophages initially but showed no evidence of spread to additional cells during the culture period. This effect on virus spread appeared to be macrophage-specific as it was not observed in cultures of T lymphocytes. Comparison of recombinant clones containing V1, V2, and V3 envelope sequences from high-efficiency Ba-L and JR-FL strains indicated that markedly different V1 and V2 sequences could impart the same rapidly spreading phenotype in macrophages.\",\"The outer membrane glycoprotein gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 are predominant targets of the humoral immune response to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The third hypervariable region (V3 loop) is the principal neutralizing domain and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies directed against the envelope proteins of HIV-1. The V3 loop is also the major determinant for HIV-1 cell-specific tropism. To further characterize the humoral immune response directed against the gp120 envelope proteins, we expressed two prototypic gp120 envelope proteins (LAI/HXB2 and ADA) and chimeric gp120 envelope proteins in stable transfected Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells. Sera from four infected adults over the course of infection [McNearney et al. (1992) Proc. natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, p. 10,242] were assayed for reactivity with the respective envelope proteins. Sera obtained at early stages preferentially recognized the gp120 envelope protein ADA, whereas in later stages of infection the sera showed diminished reactivity with both gp120 LAI/HXB2 and gp120 ADA. Chimeric envelope proteins revealed that the humoral response was directed primarily against the V3 loop of gp120 ADA. Furthermore, 22 sera from HIV-1 infected individuals in different stages of the disease were tested. Reactivity of sera with the gp120 envelope protein ADA was seven-fold higher than with the gp120 envelope protein LAI/HXB2. Our results suggest that the humoral immune response is preferentially elicited against the V3 loop of the prototypic macrophage-tropic gp120 envelope protein ADA.\",\"Although microglia are the only cells found to be productively infected in the central nervous system of acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) patients, there is extensive white and gray matter disease nonetheless. This neuropathogenesis is believed to be due to indirect mechanisms other than infection with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Cytokines and toxic small molecules have been implicated in the clinical and histopathological findings in CNS AIDS. Previously, we have demonstrated in rodent glial cultures the presence of biologically active epitopes of gp120 and gp41 that are capable of inducing interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In this study, we map the HIV-1 envelope epitopes that induce nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha in human glial cultures. Epitopes in the carboxy terminus of gp120 and the amino terminus of gp41 induce these proinflammatory entities. In addition, we compare HIV-1 infection and pathology in glial cells derived from human brain taken at different states of maturation (fetal, neonatal, and adult brain) in an effort to address some of the clinical and histological differences seen in vivo. This study demonstrates that, in the absence of virus infection and even in the absence of distinct viral tropism, human glia respond like rodent glia to non-CD4-binding epitopes of gp120/gp41 with cytokine and nitric oxide production. Differences among fetal, neonatal, and adult glial cells' infectivity and cytokine production indicate that, in addition to functional differences of glia at different stages of development, cofactors in vitro and in vivo may also be critical in facilitating the biological responses of these cells to HIV-1.\",\"We investigated the relationship between the fusion selectivity of the envelope glycoprotein (env) and the tropism of different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates for CD4+ human T-cell lines vs. primary macrophages. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were prepared encoding the envs from several well-characterized HIV-1 isolates with distinct cytotropisms. Cells expressing the recombinant envs were mixed with various CD4+ partner cell types; cell fusion was monitored by a quantitative reporter gene assay and by syncytia formation. With CD4+ continuous cell lines as partners (T-cell lines, HeLa cells expressing recombinant CD4), efficient fusion occurred with the envs from T-cell line-tropic isolates (IIIB, LAV, SF2, and RF) but not with the envs from macrophage-tropic isolates (JR-FL, SF162, ADA, and Ba-L). The opposite selectivity pattern was observed with primary macrophages as cell partners; stronger fusion occurred with the envs from the macrophage-tropic than from the T-cell line-tropic isolates. All the envs showed fusion activity with peripheral blood mononuclear cells as partners, consistent with the ability of this cell population to support replication of all the corresponding HIV-1 isolates. These fusion selectivities were maintained irrespective of the cell type used to express env, thereby excluding a role for differential host cell modification. We conclude that the intrinsic fusion selectivity of env plays a major role in the tropism of a HIV-1 isolate for infection of CD4+ T-cell lines vs. primary macrophages, presumably by determining the selectivity of virus entry and cell fusion.\",\"HIV-1 cell tropisms are partly determined by the hypervariable loops V1/V2 and V3 in gp120, which also contain epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. Mutations conferring tropism changes can result in escape from neutralization and vice versa. We examine whether variant viruses that can colonize new cell types and simultaneously escape neutralizing antibodies have an enhanced advantage in vivo.\",\"Experiments to identify cell determinants involved in HIV-1 tropism revealed a specific decrease in the expression of the T-cell activation antigen CD26 after monocytotropic (M-tropic) but not T-cell line-tropic (T-tropic) virus infection of the PM1 T-cell line. The level of CD26 expression in single-cell clones of PM1 correlated with the entry rate and cytopathicity of M-tropic HIV-1 variants, resulting in preferential survival of cells with low CD26 levels after infection. Experiments with recombinant viruses showed that the third hypervariable region of the envelope gp120 plays an important role in this selection process. This study identifies CD26 as a key marker for M-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and suggests a mechanism for the early loss of CD26-expressing cells in HIV-1-infected individuals.\",\"Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) can enhance the cytopathic effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in cells doubly infected by HIV-1 and HHV-6. HHV-6 enhances transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, and several HHV-6 trans-activator genes have been identified. Since HIV-1 and HHV-6 have similar cellular tropism, and since HIV-1 trans-activates other herpesviruses, a reciprocal interaction between the two viruses is possible. Interactions between HIV-1 and HHV-6 were analyzed in human umbilical cord blood (CB) lymphocytes and in a T-cell line by transfection and infection experiments. CB cells dually infected with HIV-1 and HHV-6 showed an increase in HHV-6 infectious titer, an increase in HHV-6-specific immediate early RNA, and an increase in HHV-6 protein synthesis. Similarly, T-lymphocyte cells transfected with the entire HIV-1 proviral genome displayed an increase in HHV-6. When T-cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the HIV-1 tat gene under control of the simian virus (SV40) promoter and infected with HHV-6, higher levels of HHV-6 proteins and infectious virus were detected. Therefore, the presence of HIV-1 gene products, such as tat, can lead to an activation of HHV-6 expression. Since HHV-6 is cytopathic, its activation by HIV-1 may accelerate the depletion of CD4+ T-cells in infected individuals.\",\"A T-cell-line-tropic, syncytium-inducing, sCD4- and serum neutralization-sensitive variant (R3H) of the macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing, sCD4- and serum neutralization-resistant molecular clone HIV-1SF162 was obtained by passage through the T-cell line HUT 78. Sequence analyses of the V1-V5 regions of envelope gp120 of the variant R3H revealed amino acid substitutions in the V3 (amino acids 307, 312) and V4 (amino acid 390) domains. Site-directed mutagenesis of the HIV-1SF162 genome showed that specific mutations in the V3 loop of this isolate can alter tropism and cytopathicity of the virus, but only moderately affect its sensitivity to sCD4 and serum neutralization. These results show that adaptation to growth in T-cell lines can render a primary-like virus sensitive to sCD4 and serum neutralization. However, the extent of T-cell line tropism does not correlate with the degree of susceptibility to sCD4 and serum neutralization. The latter appears to be dependent on the amino acid compositions of the V3 loop and other regions of envelope gp120, whereas the former is primarily determined by the V3 loop. Our findings further illustrate the importance of the V3 loop in influencing HIV-1 cell tropism and syncytium formation, and the interplay among V3 loop residues in maintaining a structure of the loop that influences biological phenotype of the virus.\",\"Fresh human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from patients with AIDS were screened for infectivity in chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to identify strains potentially able to generate high virus loads in an inoculated animal. Only 3 of 23 isolates obtained were infectious in chimpanzee cells. Of these three, only one (HIV-1DH12) was able to initiate a productive infection in PBMC samples from all 25 chimpanzees tested. HIV-1DH12 tissue culture infections were characterized by extremely rapid replication kinetics, profound cytopathicity, and tropism for chimp and human PBMC, primary human macrophage, and several human T-cell lines. An infection was established within 1 week of inoculating a chimpanzee with 50 50% tissue culture infective doses of HIV-1DH12; cell-free virus was recovered from the plasma at weeks 1, 2, and 4 and was associated with the development of lymphadenopathy. Virus loads during the primary infection and at 6 months postinoculation were comparable to those reported in HIV-1-seropositive individuals.\",\"CD4 is the predominant cell membrane protein that binds human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 and facilitates HIV-1 infection, but other membrane-associated molecules may be involved in determining HIV-1 cellular infection. Our prior work had suggested that CD44, the transmembrane receptor for hyaluronan, might play a role in the infection of mononuclear phagocytes with HIV-1. In the present work, we have used cells of the CD4-positive, CD44-negative human T-lymphoblast cell line Jurkat to study the role of CD44 in HIV-1 infection and tropism. Cells were transfected with cDNA for the standard (S, or hematopoietic) CD44 isoform CD44S or the epithelial isoform CD44E. The resultant lines expressed appropriate CD44S or CD44E mRNA and protein. While the parent Jurkat cells, those transfected with vector alone, and those transfected with CD44E could be productively infected with only the lymphocytotropic strain HIV-1-LAI, cells transfected with CD44S were rendered susceptible to productive infection with the monocytotropic strains HIV-1-BaL and HIV-1-ADA. Also, CD44S-transfected cells displayed higher levels of infection with HIV-1-LAI than did the other transfected Jurkat cells. The transfected cell line cells all had comparable growth rates and expressed similar levels of the membrane antigens CD4, CD7, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, and CD11a, while levels of CD3 were slightly higher in cells transfected with vector alone and in one of the clones transfected with CD44S. Hyaluronan binding was increased in cells transfected with either CD44S or CD44E. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with human CD4, human CD44S, or both human CD4 and CD44S displayed the appropriate antigens, but they could not be productively infected with lymphocytotropic or monocytotropic strains of HIV-1. The results indicate that in human leukocytes, CD44S is an important determinant of HIV-1 productive infection and may be involved in viral cellular tropism.\",\"Phenotypic characterization of subtype B strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) indicates that the major determinants of their cytopathogenicity and tropism are contained in the gene coding for the envelope glycoprotein gp120, namely in its variable regions V1, V2, and V3. Recombinant viruses derived from HIV-1 LAV, the subtype B prototype virus, and HIV-1 NDK, the Zairian subtype D virus highly cytopathic for CD4-positive lymphocytes, were used to elucidate genetic control of fusogenic functions in subtype D viruses. Our data demonstrate that multigenic determination of fusogenic properties is more complex in the subtype D than in clade B viruses. Variability in three regions of HIV-1 NDK genome correlated with formation of large syncytia. These regions consisted of the matrix protein, the C-terminal portion of vpr up to the C1 region of gp120, and the V1-V3 regions of gp120. Variability in the envelope glycoprotein but not in other regions of the HIV-1 genome was related to enhanced resistance of HIV-1 NDK to treatment of target cells with OKT4-A anti-CD4 MAb. Therefore, a different genetic control affects two aspects of HIV-1 fusogenicity: (i) variability in the envelope glycoprotein itself is sufficient to influence a virus-to-cell fusion at the virus/cell entry, and (ii) a more complex genetic function including genes of matrix protein and envelope glycoprotein is related to variability of cell-to-cell fusion during formation of syncytium.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates derived directly from clinical samples are usually unable to grow in cytokine-independent continuous cell lines, thus hindering the study of their biological features and their sensitivity to humoral and cellular protective immunity. To overcome these limitations, we have derived from the Hut78 T-cell line a CD4+ clone (PM1) characterized by a unique susceptibility to a wide range of HIV-1 isolates, including primary and biologically pure macrophage (M phi)-tropic isolates (e.g., HIV-1BaL), which are unable to infect other human T- or promonocytic cell lines. Both primary and M phi-tropic HIV-1 establish persistent infection in PM1, with sustained levels of virus replication for prolonged periods. Experiments with chimeric viruses containing envelope fragments of HIV-1BAL inserted into the genetic framework of HXB2, a molecular clone derived from the cell-line-tropic isolate HIV-1IIIB, showed the third hypervariable domain (V3) of gp120 to be a critical determinant of the cell line tropism of HIV-1. Nevertheless, the V3 loop of HIV-1BaL was not sufficient to confer on the chimeras a bona fide M phi tropism. The biological characteristics of HIV-1BaL and of a primary isolate (HIV-1(573)) were investigated by using the PM1 clone. Infection of PM1 by HIV-1BaL was critically dependent on the CD4 receptor, as shown by competition experiments with an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (OKT4a) or with soluble CD4. However, the amount of soluble CD4 required for inhibition of HIV-1BaL was approximately 100-fold higher than for HIV-1IIIB, suggesting that the affinity of HIV-1BaL for CD4 is significantly lower. Infection of PM1 with either HIV-1BaL or HIV-1(573) failed to induce downregulation of surface CD4 expression and syncytium formation. Analogous results were obtained with a chimeric virus (HXB2[BaL PvuII-BamHI]) encompassing a large portion of gp120 and gp41 of HIV-1BaL, indicating that the env genes contain critical determinants for CD4 downregulation and syncytium formation. Consistent with the lack of CD4 downregulation, persistent infection of PM1 by HIV-1BaL or HIV-1(573) failed to interfere with HIV-1IIIB superinfection, as revealed by the expression of a type-specific V3 loop epitope (M77) and by the induction of extensive syncytium formation. This lack of interference suggests that a direct viral interaction may occur in vivo between biologically diverse HIV-1 strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\",\"Astrocyte cultures from human fetal brain were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) either as free virus or with a chronically infected lymphoblastoid cell line and monitored for signs of infection. The lymphocytotropic strains HIV3B and HIVSF2(ARV-2) but not the monocytotropic strain HIVAda-M infected the human fetal astrocytes. The infected cells were monitored by immunocytochemistry, detection of p24 antigen in the supernatants and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the proviral DNA. No morphological or cytopathic effects were seen in these cells. Upon co-culture of astrocytes with a lymphoblastoid cell line chronically infected with HIVSF2(ARV-2), the lymphoblastoid cells readily adhered to the astrocytes as determined by a 51Cr adhesion assay and by light and electron microscopy. This cell to cell contact resulted in infection of increased numbers of astrocytes. Similar adhesion of lymphoblasts to microglia was not seen. Thus, astrocytes from human fetal brain can be infected in vitro directly by lymphocytotropic strains of HIV or by adherence to infected lymphoblastoid cells.\",\"The V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is both a determinant of viral cell tropism and a target for neutralizing antibodies. This relationship was investigated. Selection of a dual-tropic (T cells and macrophages) virus to replicate in CD4+ brain cells results in loss of macrophage tropism and of neutralization by an anti-V3 loop monoclonal antibody. Moreover, selection of the brain-selected variant to escape from V3 loop-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies results in the reduction or loss of brain cell tropism and the reacquisition of macrophage tropism. These data may indicate that the antigenic diversification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 apparent after seroconversion can be selected either by immune responses or by colonization of new cell types.\",\"To investigate genotypes and serotypes of HIV-1 variants in Russia, Byelorussia and Lithuania. Sera from 20 HIV-1-infected individuals were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with 19 V3 synthetic peptides, and serum HIV-1 V3 RNA was amplified and sequenced. Sequence comparison of the envelope V3 region among specimens tested revealed a 2-29% range nucleotide divergence, with a mean of 19%. Phylogenetic analysis from the homosexual men were shown to belong to subtype B, and all of the heterosexually infected individuals to subtype C. Sequences from the parenterally infected individuals were more heterogeneous. IOn the peptide ELISA three reactivity patterns were found. Serum samples from six out of seven homosexual men showed reactivity to peptides p108 or p110 representing V3 amino-acid sequences found in US/West European HIV-1 isolates. Serum samples from six of seven individuals who had acquired HIV-1 through heterosexual contacts were reactive to peptide p169. Four out of six parenterally infected patients had peak reactivity to p168. Distinct HIV-1 variants were found in Russia, Byelorussia and Lithuania, which were introduced simultaneously in the mid-1980s. This diversity was shown to be associated with the route of transmission. Homosexual men appeared to be infected with subtype B and heterosexually infected individuals with subtype C HIV-1 variants. HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D and G were found among parenterally infected individuals.\",\"To investigate the role of maternal HIV-1 isolate phenotype and a child's cell susceptibility/resistance to viral infection in mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission. Forty-nine women were studied at the time of delivery. Primary isolates, obtained by culturing patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with PBMC from healthy donors, were characterized for tropism and syncytium-inducing capability in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and in the MT-2 and MOLT-3 T-cell lines. Seven women transmitted HIV-1 to their children. Primary isolates were obtained from six and 28 transmitting and non-transmitting mothers, respectively. All primary isolates from transmitting mothers and their infants but only 50% of those from non-transmitting mothers replicated in MDM, regardless of their replication capacity in T-cell lines. PBL and MDM cells from six uninfected children were exposed to the corresponding maternal isolates. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of HIV-1 DNA in cells and p24 antigen assay in culture supernatants disclosed that two PBL and five MDM cultures were resistant to viral infection; two other PBL cultures, although HIV-1-infected, were negative for p24 production. Depletion of CD8+ cells only partially restored productive infection in CD4+ cell cultures. Moreover, all six PBL but only one MDM cultures were productively infected by an isolate obtained from a transmitting mother, thus suggesting that MDM resistance to HIV-1 infection is not viral isolate-restricted. Our findings strongly suggest that mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission is influenced by both monocyte-macrophage tropism of the maternal isolate and susceptibility of the child's target cells, in particular monocyte-macrophages, to HIV-1 infection.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) primary isolates, derived from donors at various stages of HIV infection, were assayed for their sensitivity to interferon (IFN)-alpha 2 in vitro. These isolates displayed a broad range of sensitivity to IFN-alpha 2. The prevalence of IFN-alpha 2 resistance was low in the absence of AIDS but dramatically increased once HIV infection progressed to AIDS. Although there was no linear correlation between the percentage of IFN-alpha 2 inhibition in vitro and the CD4 cell number in vivo or the level of endogenous IFN-alpha, serum IFN-alpha levels were higher in donors with AIDS and were associated with low CD4 cell numbers. Thus, circulating IFN-alpha appeared to either promote resistance or favor survival of IFN-alpha resistant variants. IFN-alpha 2 resistance was neither limited to a particular cell tropism nor enhanced by therapy with zidovudine. Sequential analysis indicated that reversion to IFN-alpha 2 sensitivity could occur during the course of infection.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) typically evolves from a macrophage-tropic, noncytopathic virus at early asymptomatic stages of infection to a T-cell-tropic, cytopathic, and syncytia-inducing virus population as humans progress to AIDS. This suggests that changes in virus phenotype may influence disease. Because simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques is a common model system for HIV-1 pathogenesis, we determined whether SIV infection in macaques that develop simian AIDS is associated with a similar shift in viral tropism, replication, and cytopathic properties. The virus that infected the monkeys (SIVMneCL8) and predominated at early times in infection is a macrophage-tropic virus that replicates with relatively low efficiency in human T cell lines. The variant populations that arise in macaques as they progress to AIDS are more infectious for human T cell lines, exhibiting enhanced replication in CEM x 174 cells and an expanded host range that includes Molt-4 Clone 8 cells. Infections starting with equal doses of the viruses demonstrated that the late variants are cytopathic and syncytia-inducing compared to SIVMneCL8, but the variants replicate less efficiently in primary macaque macrophages. V3 sequences were generally conserved between the early and the late variants, suggesting that changes in SIVMne tropism, replication, and cytopathicity were apparently not due to alterations in V3. This study demonstrates important similarities in the phenotypic viral changes that accompany development of AIDS in SIV and HIV-1 infections and suggest that SIV may provide a model system for determining whether the rapidly replicating, T-cell-tropic cytopathic variants present late in infection and disease are indeed important in determining progression to AIDS.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates differ in their ability to productively infect macrophages, and several groups have mapped the genetic basis for macrophage tropism to regions of env that include the third hypervariable region (V3 loop). We recently described a primary isolate (89.6) which is highly macrophage tropic and yet differs from other macrophage-tropic strains studied in that it is cytopathic in T cells. Genetic mapping of macrophage tropism determinants in this virus was done by using chimeras generated with the prototypic non-macrophage-tropic strain HXB2. Replacement of a 2.7-kb env-containing region of HXB with corresponding sequences from 89.6 conferred the macrophage-tropic phenotype, but insertion of the 89.6 V3 loop along with V4/V5 sequences did not. Conversely, placement of HXB sequences that included V3 into 89.6 did not impair this strain's ability to replicate in macrophages. Sequence analysis of V3 shows that 89.6 differs markedly from previously described macrophage-tropic consensus sequences and that it is more similar to highly charged non-macrophage-tropic strains. This suggests either that macrophage tropism is defined by structural determinants resulting from complex interactions among multiple env regions rather than V3 sequence-specific requirements or that there are multiple mechanisms by which different strains may establish productive macrophage infection. In addition, because the HXB V3 loop supports productive macrophage infection in the background of 89.6, phenotypic characterization of V3 sequences should be considered specific to the viral context in which they are placed.\",\"Antipeptide sera raised against the gp120/gp41 sequences of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were used to determine their capacity to enhance infection. Antisera to the five variable regions (V1 to V5) of gp120 and conserved parts of gp120 and gp41 facilitated infection of primary human macrophages with the homologous virus HIV-1 SF2mc. In contrast, heterologous virus infection with HTLV-IIIB was mediated only by antisera to the conserved regions, predominantly C4 and C5. Heterologous virus infection occurred more rapidly and was consistent between different cell donors. The neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) SC258 (murine IgG2a) but not MAb 684-238 (mIgG1) against conformational epitopes of the V2 region also induced antibody-dependent infection enhancement (ADE). Therefore, preincubation with certain antibodies can cause altered tropism of the lymphocytotropic viruses mentioned above. Viral infection was completely abolished by preincubation with the F(ab)2 fragment of MAb 3G8 against the Fc gamma receptor III (CD16). A MAb (7.3F11) against the gp120-binding site of CD4 had no effect on viral infectivity. Possible mechanisms and their implications for disease progression are discussed.\",\"Prior studies with recombinant viruses constructed in vitro showed that the V2 domain of envelope gp120, in addition to the required V3 domain, enhances the efficiency of infection of primary macrophages by HIV-1. Present structural studies on the gp120s of these recombinant viruses using three human monoclonal antibodies directed to the V3 loop indicate that the V2 domain affects cell tropism by modulating the conformation of the V3 loop. Additional mutational analyses of the V2 domain of the T-cell line-tropic virus HIV-1SF2 reveal that single amino acid sequence changes, mainly those affecting the location of potential N-linked glycosylation sites and the positive charge of this region, can also alter tropism. These amino acid substitutions in the V2 domain, however, do not appear to alter the conformation of the V3 loop. Thus, the V2 domain of gp120 can influence cell tropism through both an effect on V3 as well as via a V3-independent mechanism.\",\"The relationship between the genetic variability in the V3 loop and the biological characteristics of 38 biological clones from 5 European and 7 African HIV-1 isolates belonging to 3 different subtypes (subtype A, B, and D) was investigated. Seventeen of 19 clones displaying a syncytium-inducing (SI) capacity had a positively charged amino acid located at position 11 and/or 25 in the V3 loop sequence. All 19 non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) virus clones lacked such a positive charge at the same positions (p < 0.001). The mean of net charge in the overall V3 loop sequences of the SI clones was higher than that of the NSI clones (p < 0.001). Within the same strains, the SI clones replicated faster/higher than the NSI clones in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p < 0.01), but not in CD4+ T cell cultures (p > 0.1). All SI clones but only 5 of 19 NSI clones could replicate in human continuous T cell and monocytic cell lines (p < 0.001). A higher number of positively charged amino acid substitutions was found among the subtype D SI clones. Only one of eight autologous sera tested had the ability to neutralize the contemporaneously isolated NSI clones, but not the SI clones. This study indicates that the V3 loop amino acid sequences of HIV-1 biological clones from different origins belonging to different genetic subtypes are clearly correlated with viral syncytium-inducing capacity, cell tropism, and replication rate.\",\"Attempts to define the genetic determinants required for efficient growth of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in monocyte-macrophages were made by constructing chimeras between two infectious clones of HIV-1 (HXB2 and LW/C), which despite only minor differences in their DNA sequence have striking differences in cell tropism. Although both of them replicate efficiently in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HXB2 replicates extensively in permanent T cell lines but poorly in primary monocyte macrophages (T cell line tropic); the reverse is true for LW/C (macrophage tropic). The envelope proved to contain the major determinants of macrophage tropism. However, tropism determinants appeared to be scattered along the envelope. In particular, the V3 loop alone appeared to be neither necessary nor sufficient for growth in macrophages. Both vpr and nef genes appeared to play a less significant role to improve viral replication in macrophages, but only in the presence of the proper envelope sequences. HIV-1 macrophage tropism thus appears to result from the contribution of several different determinants.\",\"Differences in kinetics of infection, cellular tropism, and cytopathology of SIV and HIV appear to depend on both viral and host factors. We investigated the role of critical CD4 structures from African green monkeys (AGM) a natural SIV host, from pig-tailed macaques (PT) an unnatural SIV host, and from humans, as well as the role of species-specific cellular factors involved in the tropism, kinetics of infection, and cytopathic effects of several SIV and HIV-1. Critical regions of the PT macaque and AGM CD4 genes (V1, V1J1, and V1J1V2J2) were stably expressed as chimeras with the human CD4 gene in human (HeLa and 293) and macaque (CMMT) cell lines. CD4 expressing cell lines were used for infection studies with cell-free SIVsm, SIVmac, SIVsmmPBj, SIVagm, and HIV-1. Results show that both PT CD4 and AGM CD4 supported infection with comparable infection kinetics by all SIV or HIV-1 strains tested. Although structural analysis predicted a major change in secondary structure of AGM CD4/CDR-3, these structural changes did not influence the degree of syncytia formation induced by several SIV and HIV-1. However, the cell line used to express the CD4 gene appeared to be a critical determinant of infection. Thus, SlV strains did not infect human cell lines regardless of the CD4 expressed in these cells. In contrast, HIV-1 did not infect any macaque cell line. This study demonstrates that the differences in CD4 structure among different primate species are clearly not responsible for differences in SIV and HIV infection kinetics, tropism, and cytopathology. However, species-specific factor(s), presumably expressed on the cell surface, markedly influences the ability of SIV or HIV to infect cells expressing CD4.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants passaged in T-cell lines, often called laboratory isolates, are potently neutralized by soluble CD4 (sCD4), whereas primary HIV-1 variants are highly resistant to sCD4 neutralization. Previously, it was demonstrated that the domain from V1 to V3 of the HIV-1 gp120 molecule contains one of the major determinants of sCD4 neutralization sensitivity, and the same region has also been implicated as influencing syncytium-inducing (SI) capacity and T-cell-line tropism. To determine possible differences in sCD4 neutralization sensitivity between phenotypically distinct primary HIV-1 variants, a panel of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and SI HIV-1 variants was studied. Primary NSI and SI HIV-1 variants appeared to be equally resistant to sCD4 neutralization. Consistent with this observation, sCD4 did not induce gp120 shedding from either primary NSI or SI HIV-1 variants at 37 degrees C. Thus, it is not the potential of certain primary HIV-1 variants to infect T-cell lines but rather their adaptation to T-cell lines that is reflected in specific properties of the viral envelope which influence sCD4 neutralization sensitivity.\",\"Seven diverse primary isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were examined and found to be refractory to neutralization by antisera to recombinant gp120 (rgp120) protein from HIV-1 MN. This stands in marked contrast to the sensitivity exhibited by certain laboratory-adapted viruses. To understand the difference between primary and laboratory-adapted viruses, we adapted the primary virus ACH 168.10 to growth in the FDA/H9 cell line. ACH 168.10 was chosen because the V3 region of gp120 closely matches that of MN. After 4 weeks, infection became evident. The virus (168A) replicated in FDA/H9 cells with extensive cytopathic effect but was unchanged in sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, growth in cell lines is not sufficient to render primary virus sensitive to neutralization. The 168A virus was, however, partially sensitive to CD4 immunoadhesin (CD4-Ig). Adaptation was continued to produce a persistently infected FDA/H9 culture that displayed minimal cytopathic effect. The virus (168C) was now sensitive to neutralization by MN rgp120 vaccine sera and by MN-specific monoclonal antibodies and showed increased sensitivity to HIVIG and CD4-Ig. 168C encoded three amino acid changes in gp120, including one within the V3 loop (I-166-->R, I-282-->N, G-318-->R). MN-specific monoclonal antibodies bound equally to the surface of cells infected with either neutralization-resistant or -sensitive virus. The coincidence of changes in neutralization sensitivity with changes in cell tropism and cytopathic effect suggests a common underlying mechanism(s) acting through the whole of the envelope protein complex.\",\"Interactions between HIV-1 and CMV may be important in the pathogenesis of AIDS. We have studied whether active CMV infection alters the cell tropism of HIV-1 in dually-infected individuals. Urines from HIV-seropositive individuals excreting CMV were compared to urines from CMV non-excretors. Sixty-six urines from HIV-seropositive individuals were tested. Infectious HIV-1 was not detected in any of the concentrated urines tested. The urines were filtered, concentrated, DNase-treated and cultured on HIV-1 non-permissive human forestin fibroblasts. HIV-1 DNA was detected by PCR with pol gene primers in 5 of 39 MRHF cell cultures inoculated with CMV culture positive urine (p = 0.037). HIV-1 DNA was not detected by PCR in uninfected fibroblasts, in fibroblasts inoculated with CMV uninfected urine from 27 HIV-seropositive patients or in fibroblasts cultured with 9 CMV culture positive urines from 16 HIV-seronegative renal transplant recipients. Supernatant fluid from an HIV-1 PCR-positive culture was passaged onto another fibroblast monolayer, and these cells were negative for HIV-1 DNA. Direct inoculation of fibroblasts with HIV-1 did not yield evidence of infection by PCR. CMV infection may facilitate HIV-1 DNA entry into ordinarily non-permissive cells.\",\"The third variable region (V3) of the envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contains group- and type-specific epitopes for neutralizing antibodies and contains determinants involved in viral tropism and syncytium-inducing (SI) activity. We studied the in vivo relationship between V3 sequences and viral phenotypes in 24 perinatally HIV-1-infected children. To avoid in vitro selection of intrapatient minor variants, genetic studies were performed directly on uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and the tropisms of HIV-1 isolates were evaluated by culturing patients' PBMC directly with monocyte-derived macrophages, lymphocytes, and MT-2 cells. According to their phenotypes, we could define five types of primary isolates: (i) non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) macrophagetropic, (ii) NSI macrophage-lymphotropic, (iii) NSI lymphotropic, (iv) SI lympho-T-cell line-tropic, and (v) SI pleiotropic. The SI viral phenotype was correlated with a more advanced status of disease. Genetic analysis of intrapatient molecular variants revealed that no relationship between the degree of intrapatient V3 variability and the pattern of viral tropism existed; moreover, within a single patient, the values for V3 variability between CD4+ lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes were similar, thus suggesting that in vivo variability of the monocytotropic variants is more extensive than previously appreciated. A comparison between the intrapatient major variants and the phenotype of primary isolates disclosed that a negatively charged amino acid at residue site 25 was associated with an NSI macrophage- and macrophage-lymphotropic viral phenotype. Finally, by comparing the V3 sequences derived from our study population with those of several prototypes, we observed that the majority of isolates circulating in Italy are related to the North American subtype B macrophagetropic isolates.\",\"The correlation of the tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates for MT-2 cells with response to zidovudine and didanosine treatment and with development of drug resistance was studied. Patients with MT-2-negative but not MT-2-positive HIV-1 had a significant increase in CD4+ lymphocyte counts during the first 6 months of treatment. In both groups and for both drugs, the rate of CD4+ lymphocyte decline decreased after the start of treatment. MT-2-positive isolates were more likely than MT-2-negative isolates to show reduced sensitivity to zidovudine and didanosine. Because the differences in zidovudine sensitivity were first evident after 12 months of treatment, drug resistance was probably not the cause of poor response early in zidovudine treatment in patients with MT-2-positive HIV-1. Thus, patients with MT-2-positive virus have limited benefit from treatment with single nucleoside analogues. Knowledge of MT-2 cell tropism may be important in clinical trials and for choosing treatments for patients.\",\"Proviral clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 which contained single amino acid changes in the envelope V3 region were constructed. PCR amplification of Sup-T1 T cells transfected with one such mutant, G312T, revealed low levels of virus that resulted in the generation of a revertant virus, in which an alanine replaced the threonine residue at amino acid 312. The revertant virus (rA312) was fully infectious in Sup-T1 cells but lacked the ability to infect AA5 cells. The presence of a second mutation in a subsequent revertant virus (rR306), in which arginine was substituted for serine at amino acid 306 within the V3 loop, restored the ability of the mutated virus to infect AA5 cells. Our data highlight the importance of the V3 loop in defining virus tropism for specific cell types in culture and further suggest that a degree of interplay exists among V3 loop residues that helps maintain or control its biological function of the virus.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 circulates in vivo as a mixture of heterologous populations (quasispecies). We previously analyzed the quasispecies of the third hypervariable region (V3) in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 in an infected individual and found that the species with a basic amino acid substitution (lysine for aspartic acid) at a particular position evolved and became a distinct population within a short period, followed by progression to the typical immunodeficiency stage (S. Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:271-277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this amino acid substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single basic amino acid substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic amino acid at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this amino acid substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the basic amino acid substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that basic amino acid substitutions in V3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression.\",\"We and others have identified the major determinant of cell tropism in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as the V3 loop of glycoprotein gp120. We have conducted a detailed study of two molecularly cloned isolates of HIV-1, HIVJR-CSF and HIVNL4-3, that differ in their tropism for immortalized CD4+ cell lines, by constructing a series of site-directed mutations within the V3 loop of HIVJR-CSF based on the sequence of HIVNL4-3. The phenotypes of these mutants fall into two classes, those which are viable and those which are not. A spontaneous mutant with significantly altered growth properties was also recovered and found to have an additional single amino acid change in the V3 loop sequence. The carboxy-terminal beta-strand part of the V3 loop is the major determinant of cell tropism. However, the results presented here indicate that the functional role of the V3 loop sequences can only be interpreted properly in the context of the original gp120 backbone from which they were derived. These findings show that over-simplistic interpretation of sequence data derived from unknown mixtures of HIV variants in infected persons may be highly misleading.\",\"Macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing, HIV-1 variants predominate in the asymptomatic phase of infection and may be responsible for establishing infection in an individual exposed to the mixture of HIV-1 variants. Here, genotypical and phenotypical characteristics of virus populations, present in sexual, parenteral, or vertical donor-recipient pairs, were studied. Sequence analysis of the V3 domain confirmed the presence of a homogeneous virus population in recently infected individuals. Biological HIV-1 clones were further characterized for syncytium inducing capacity on the MT2 cell line and for macrophage tropism as defined by the appearance of proviral DNA upon inoculation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Both sexual and parenteral transmission cases revealed a selective outgrowth in the recipient of the most macrophage-tropic variant(s) present in the donor. In three out of five vertical transmission cases, more than one highly macrophage-tropic virus variant was present in the child shortly after birth, suggestive of transmission of multiple variants. In three primary infection cases, homogeneous virus populations of macrophage-tropic, non-syncytium-inducing variants were present prior to seroconversion, thus excluding humoral immunity as the selective pressure in favour of macrophage-tropic variants. These observations may have important implications for vaccine development.\",\"The ability of HIV-1 to infect macrophages is thought to be essential in AIDS pathogenesis. We tested the ability of 19 primary virus isolates to infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from different donors. Two HIV-1 isolates were able to establish a productive infection in MDM from all donors tested, whereas eight completely lacked this capacity. Next to these isolates with extreme phenotypes, 50% of the primary isolates under study displayed an intermediate phenotype. These intermediate macrophage-tropic isolates established a productive infection in MDM from some but not all donors tested. PCR analysis demonstrated that the capacity to replicate in MDM could be determined at the previously described level of virus entry. However, for intermediate macrophage-tropic isolates replication was abrogated at the level of reverse transcription. Entry of highly macrophage-tropic isolates resulted in efficient completion of the reverse transcription process, whereas entry of intermediate macrophage-tropic isolates did not. Our experiments indicate that primary HIV-1 isolates may differ in their dependency on cellular factors required for reverse transcription in MDM. Differences in susceptibility of MDM for in vitro HIV-1 infection suggest variation in the availability of these cellular factors between MDM from different individuals.\",\"Previously we demonstrated an inhibitory effect of interleukin-4 (IL-4) on establishment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in primary macrophages. The reported similarities between the biological effects of IL-4 and IL-10 prompted us to study the effect of IL-10 on HIV-1 replication. Treatment of primary macrophages with IL-10 resulted in inhibition of HIV-1 infection. This inhibitory effect was specific for macrophages, since IL-10 did not interfere with HIV-1 replication in primary T cells. Semiquantitative PCR analysis excluded an inhibitory effect of IL-10 on virus entry and reverse transcription. Effects of IL-10 on HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity also could not be demonstrated in a transient expression system in primary derived macrophages. In agreement with this, Northern (RNA) blot analysis demonstrated equal amounts of viral RNA species irrespective of IL-10 treatment, also excluding an inhibitory effect on elongation of virus transcription. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) treated with IL-10 after HIV-1 inoculation showed accumulation of apparently mature p24 protein suggestive of an inhibitory effect at the level of virus assembly. IL-10 treatment of MDM prior to HIV-1 inoculation did not result in accumulation of p24 protein. Immunoblot analysis indeed showed the absence of mature p24 and gp120 but accumulation of the Pr53 gag-encoded protein in HIV-1-inoculated, IL-10-pretreated MDM, suggesting an inhibitory effect at the level of protein processing. A combination of IL-4 and IL-10 resulted in a cumulative inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication in MDM. The recent observation that in the course of HIV-1 infection a shift occurs in the production of IL-2/gamma interferon toward enhanced IL-4 and IL-10 production and the reported shift from preferential macrophage-tropic towards preferential T-cell-tropic HIV-1 variants with progression of disease suggest that cytokines have an important role in the in vivo regulation of HIV-1 tropism.\",\"Understanding the mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) kills CD4+ T lymphocytes is important to the development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. Recent studies have indicated that, in some cases, progression to AIDS is associated with the appearance of syncytium-inducing, T cell line-tropic HIV-1 variants. Nevertheless, approximately 50% of subjects with AIDS harbor only non-syncytium-inducing, macrophage-tropic (NSI-M) variants of HIV-1. In most asymptomatic patients, NSI-M HIV-1 isolates are the predominant virus type found. We report here that cytopathicity of NSI-M HIV-1 for primary CD4+ T lymphocytes can be directly detected in vitro. The extent of CD4+ T-cell killing was not completely correlated with the rate of viral replication, suggesting that other characteristics of HIV-1 contribute to its cytopathicity. Our findings suggest that: (i) direct killing by NSI-M HIV-1 may contribute to CD4+ T-lymphocyte depletion in vivo, and (ii) the determinants of HIV-1 cytopathicity for CD4+ T lymphocytes and cell tropism or syncytia-forming ability are not necessarily tightly linked.\",\"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is restricted to CD4-expressing primate cells. This tropism may be due partly to the absence from nonprimate cells of a species-specific factor which has an accessory role to CD4 during virus penetration. In this study we describe a rat B lymphocyte cell line in which there is efficient CD4-dependent entry of HIV-1. However, this cell line has a block to productive infection of HIV-1 at a stage between reverse transcription and integration. Our results demonstrate that the putative accessory factor for HIV-1 penetration is not restricted to primate cells and that there is a novel, uncharacterized cell-virus interaction at a stage between penetration and integration.\",\"We have investigated the ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 isolates to infect and replicate in primary human macrophages. Monocytes from blood donors were allowed to differentiate into macrophages by culture in the presence of autologous lymphocytes and human serum for 5 days before infection. A panel of 70 HIV-1 and 12 HIV-2 isolates were recovered from seropositive individuals with different severities of HIV infection. A majority of isolates (55 HIV-1 and all HIV-2) were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but isolates from cerebrospinal fluid, monocytes, brain tissue, plasma, and purified CD4+ lymphocytes were also included. All isolates were able to infect monocyte-derived macrophages, even though the replicative capacity of the isolates varied. Interestingly, isolates with a rapid/high, syncytium-inducing phenotype did not differ from slow/low, non-syncytium-inducing isolates in their ability to replicate in monocyte-derived macrophages. Others have reported that rapid/high, syncytium-inducing isolates have a reduced ability to infect and replicate in monocytes. However, different methods to isolate and culture the monocytes/macrophages were used in these studies and our study. Thus, the ability of HIV isolates to replicate in monocytes/macrophages appears to be strongly influenced by the isolation and culture procedures. It remains to be determined which culture procedure is more relevant for the in vivo situation.\",\"We have analyzed the phenotype of five human monocytoid cell lines (U-937, THP-1, RC.2A, Mono Mac 6, and DD) and their capacity to support replication of HIV-1 strains with known tropism for T lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. HIV-1 Ba-L, a prototype monocytotropic HIV-1 strain, was unable to establish continuous replication in any of the cell lines used. In contrast, the lymphotropic strain IIIB could replicate in all CD4-positive cell lines. We conclude that the capacity of HIV-1 isolates to replicate in established human monocytoid malignant cells does not correlate with the tropism of the virus for primary mononuclear phagocytes. Since monocytoid cell lines do not distinguish HIV-1 variants tropic for mononuclear phagocytes, we suggest the use of primary cells for studies of HIV-1 tropism.\",\"T-cell-line-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 cannot infect CD4-positive, brain-derived cells. We isolated several new variants that readily infected brain-derived cells. Mutation of proline to serine, to alanine, or to threonine in the well-conserved GPGR sequence in the V3 region of the envelope glycoprotein was found in all these variants. This indicates the importance of amino acid sequences at the tip of the V3 region for brain cell tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.\",\"The distribution, cell tropism, and cytopathology in vivo of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was investigated in postmortem tissue samples from a series of HIV-infected individuals who died either of complications associated with AIDS or for unrelated reasons while they were asymptomatic. Proviral sequences were detected at a high copy number in lymphoid tissue of both presymptomatic patients and patients with AIDS, whereas significant infection of nonlymphoid tissue such as that from brains, spinal cords, and lungs were confined to those with AIDS. V3 loop sequences from both groups showed highly restricted sequence variability and a low overall positive charge of the encoded amino acid sequence compared with those of standard laboratory isolates of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The low charge and the restriction in sequence variability were comparable to those observed with isolates showing a non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and macrophage-tropic phenotype in vitro. All patients were either exclusively infected (six of seven cases) or predominantly infected (one case) with variants with a predicted NSI/macrophage-tropic phenotype, irrespective of the degree of disease progression. p24 antigen was detected by immunocytochemical staining of paraffin-fixed sections in the germinal centers within lymphoid tissue, although little or no antigen was found in areas of lymph node or spleen containing T lymphocytes from either presymptomatic patients or patients with AIDS. The predominant p24 antigen-expressing cells in the lungs and brains of the patients with AIDS were macrophages and microglia (in brains), frequently forming multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) even though the V3 loop sequences of these variants resembled those of NSI isolates in vitro. These studies indicate that lack of syncytium-forming ability in established T-cell lines does not necessarily predict syncytium-forming ability in primary target cells in vivo. Furthermore, variants of HIV with V3 sequences characteristic of NSI/macrophage-tropic isolates form the predominant population in a range of lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues in vivo, even in patients with AIDS.\",\"To evaluate the biological and serological properties of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for factors potentially involved in the mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. Isolates of HIV-1 were recovered from the blood of 12 of 44 nontransmitting mothers and six of eight transmitting mothers and their corresponding infants. These 24 HIV-1 isolates were compared for their biological and immunologic properties to discern any parameters that correlate with vertical transmission of HIV-1. Replication capabilities of the above-mentioned HIV-1 isolates in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), human macrophages, and various T-cell lines and the susceptibilities of the viruses to neutralization or enhancement by anti-HIV-1 antibodies in autologous serum samples from mothers and infants. San Francisco Bay Area, California. A cohort of 52 HIV-1-infected women and their infants in a prospective study on perinatal HIV transmission by the Bay Area Perinatal AIDS Center. The viral isolates from the transmitting mothers and their infants differed from the isolates from the nontransmitting mothers in their efficient replication in human PBMCs and in their ability to infect one or more human T-lymphocytic cell lines. All the HIV-1 isolates were able to infect human macrophages with only low-level replication and were unable to form syncytia in the MT-2-lymphocytic cells. No correlation between transmission and reactivity of maternal serum samples to the peptide corresponding to the principal neutralization domain of the third hypervariable region of the viral envelope was observed. However, the majority (9/12) of maternal isolates from the nontransmitters were neutralized by their autologous serum samples compared with only two among six in the transmitter group (P < .07). Moreover, five infant isolates were resistant to neutralization by their respective mother's serum samples, and one was sensitive to infection enhancement by the mother's serum. Another infant isolate was enhanced by his autologous serum. Viral factors that appeared to correlate with mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 observed in a small cohort included rapid or high-titered replication in human PBMCs, T-cell line tropism, and resistance to neutralization or a sensitivity to enhancement of infection by the maternal serum.\",\"Using recombinant and mutant viruses generated between two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates that display differences in cell tropism and sensitivity to soluble CD4 neutralization, we show that these two properties of the virus are regulated by different mechanisms. Whereas there is an association between V3 loop conformation and a particular cellular tropism, soluble CD4 neutralization sensitivity appears to be determined by amino acid differences in the C2 domain of the envelope gp120 that modulate the stability of gp120-gp41 association. Our findings further illustrate the importance of functional interactions among different regions of the envelope gp120 in regulating the biological phenotypes of human immunodeficiency virus and suggest that additional probing of the V3 loop with monoclonal antibodies may identify specific structural features of this loop that determine cell tropism.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes immune dysfunction. Mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) are immune effector cells against some intracellular pathogens and reservoirs for HIV-1. This study determined effects of HIV-1 on MNP-mediated antifungal function. MNP from seronegative volunteers were inoculated with HIVBal or HIVIIIB. MNP were infected with an avirulent clone of Cryptococcus neoformans; 48 h later, MNP were lysed and yeasts were counted. Viral replication was determined by reverse transcriptase and by visualization of cytopathic effects. Monocytes and peritoneal macrophages exhibited reduced anticryptococcal activity 14 days after infection with HIVBal but retained normal activity when infected with HIVIIIB. Loss of anticryptococcal activity correlated with viral replication. Alveolar macrophages retained normal anticryptococcal activity whether infected with HIVBal or HIVIIIB. In vitro MNP-mediated antifungal activity may be altered by HIV-1 infection; this altered activity appears to depend on viral tropism, viral replication, and MNP tissue origin.\",\"HIV induces a multi-organ infection with a dual tropism for both lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. The lung is a target both for HIV infection and HIV-related opportunistic infections. The SCID mouse has provided the opportunity to develop a small animal model for HIV infection. However, HIV-1 infection of the human fetal thymus and liver (SCID Liv/Thy) implanted in these mice occurred only after direct intraimplant injection of HIV-1 and the resultant HIV-1 infection was restricted to the human thymus. Here we report that human foetal lung can develop in SCID Liv/Thy mice resulting in the development of normal human alveolar and bronchiolar lung compartments which can be productively infected with cell-free HIV-1 virus, leading to a systemic and bifocal infection. This SCID-Hu model should be useful for studying AIDS physiopathology, human viruses with lung tropism and for helping to define gene therapy protocols in lung human cells in vivo.\",\"The third variable (V3) region within the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been reported to be an important determinant of viral tropism. In this study a series of isogenic recombinant HIV-1 viruses, containing V3 regions from fresh isolates, were examined to ascertain if a relationship exists between viral tropism and specific properties of the virion-associated envelope. All of the viruses were able to infect CD4+ primary lymphocytes, although with different infection kinetics. Several recombinants, however, were unable to infect a continuous CD4+ T-cell line permissive for the parental virus and exhibited a marked decrease in the kinetics of virion-associated gp120 binding to a soluble form of CD4. A known macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolate, also unable to infect the T-cell line, bound CD4 with similarly slow reaction kinetics. Although the inability to infect T-cell lines is a commonly observed property of macrophage-tropic isolates of HIV-1, the loss of T-cell line tropism by the V3 recombinants was not accompanied by a substantial infectivity for monocyte-derived macrophages, as monitored by reverse transcriptase production. Additional analyses of the recombinant virion gp120s indicated that most of the V3 substitutions increased the inherent stability of the virion gp120-gp41 envelope complex. These results indicate that V3-induced alterations in viral tropism are associated with changes in physical and functional properties of the virion envelope.\",\"Clinical and biological features indicate that a dysregulation of microbicidal activity occurs in the cells of mononuclear phagocytic lineage of HIV-1-infected patients. Thus, the regulation of MnSOD gene expression has been investigated during the 10 h following in vitro HIV macrophage infection. As previously reported, in HIV-1 LAI-infected macrophages a high expression of the MnSOD gene is observed 2 and 4 h after infection. These results are confirmed when cells are infected with three macrophage-tropic strains HIV-1, DAS, PAR and Bal. Moreover, the detection of the MnSOD gene expression in the macrophage cultures is associated with the cellular tropism of the viral strains used. The binding of recombinant GP160 by itself is not sufficient to induce MnSOD expression. In fact, the same MnSOD gene induction was obtained with the heat inactivated viral isolates, indicating that these phenomena are due to the viral entry. On the other hand, phagocytosis of latex beads triggers a high expression of the MnSOD gene in macrophages, showing that phagocytosis of HIV may be sufficient to induce the expression of that gene. Taken together, these results indicate that the MnSOD gene expression observed within 10 h following infection of macrophages is mainly related to membrane biophysical unspecific modifications.\",\"Thirty-one different mutant forms of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) were created with changes in the region of env corresponding to the V3 domain of HIV-1. Sixteen of these mutants had one amino acid change, 12 had two changes, two had three changes, and one had four changes in the SIVmac \\\"V3\\\" loop. The ability of the mutant viruses to replicate in CEMx174 cells, rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages was investigated. Ten of the mutant viruses replicated with approximately wild-type kinetics in all three cell types. Of the 31 mutants, 22 were able to replicate in one or more of the cell types. Thus, this region of SIVmac gp120 is quite tolerant to change. Nine of the mutants replicated poorly or not at all in any of the cells tested. The lack of replication competence of some of the mutants was associated with inefficient proteolytic processing of the gp160 precursor. Some mutations had dramatic differential effects in different cell types. For example, changing P to S at position 321 and M to I at position 325 drastically reduced replication in macrophages and CEMx174 cells but had no effect on replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Mutants with altered tropism were blocked at an early stage that includes virus entry into cells. Thus, sequences in SIVmac that correspond to V3 in HIV-1 can affect virus entry and cell tropism in a manner analogous to that of HIV-1 V3.\",\"Extensive data have been obtained on sequence changes in the V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope protein that are associated with in vitro biological properties such as cell tropism and syncytium-inducing capacity. However, so far this concerned viruses isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and thus did not discriminate between variants present in T lymphocytes or in monocytes. In this study, we analyzed viral sequences derived separately from uncultured T lymphocytes, blood monocytes, and plasma of an HIV-1-infected patient showing a neurological evolution of the disease. Sequences related to the V3 region and 18 amino acids downstream were obtained from 48 clones after PCR amplification. One predominant viral sequence close to the monocytotropic/non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) consensus sequence was observed in the three blood sources. Two viral species were specifically identified in monocytes (43% of the clones), showing clear differences from the consensus sequence and exhibiting the genetic determinants associated with the SI phenotype. Plasma-derived viruses with a similar V3 loop were obtained on in vitro isolation. Analysis of the biological properties of these selected viruses confirmed their monocytotropism and the syncytium-inducing phenotype as expected by the cell type in which the sequences were observed and the charge of the V3 loop. Structural analysis of these variants suggested an intermediate structure between NSI/monocytotropic and SI/lymphotropic V3 loops. Thus, in vivo circulating monocytes could be a reservoir for distinct HIV-1 variants with potential SI characteristics, at least in later stages of infection. Studying such variants over the course of the infection may shed light on their involvement in disease manifestations.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive individuals are known to have a population of CD8+T lymphocytes which can suppress the replication of the virus. Two hundred and twelve peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples obtained from 42 seropositive individuals were examined for HIV-1 isolation. HIV-1 recovery rate reached almost 90% by coculture of CD8+ cell-depleted PBMC with uninfected normal PBMC. These results indicated the usefulness of panning method of CD8+ cell for isolation of HIV-1 from asymptomatic carriers (AC). To investigate the suppressive effect of CD8+ cells on HIV-1 replication, we characterized HIV-1 isolates from the same blood samples obtained from five AC individuals before and after the removal of CD8+ cells. Comparative studies of paired isolates revealed significant differences in their replication kinetics in the presence of autologous or allogeneic CD8+ cells. The paired isolates from four out of 5 AC individuals revealed significant differences in their genetic structures, although their biological properties, such as replication rate of cell tropism, were almost the same between the paired isolates. One exception, that of paired isolates from one AC with clinical data of near AIDS-related complex showed a similar genetic structure and similar biological properties. Thus, we showed that many AC individuals during the early clinical stages simultaneously carried two or more replication-competent HIV-ls in vivo which have different genomic backgrounds and sensitivity to the antiviral effects of CD8+ cells.\",\"Heterosexual intercourse is the major mode of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide. Heterosexual transmission of HIV is particularly important in Africa and is increasing in the developed world. The mechanism of HIV infection of the female genital tract with HIV and subsequent events leading to clinical infection are not fully understood. In particular, the primary cellular targets of HIV infection in the female genital tract have not been determined. We have established an in vitro model for studying HIV infection of the human adult cervix by HIV. Human cervical mucosal explants were briefly exposed to HIV strains of different tropism and maintained in organ culture for 7 days. HIV infection detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization was only observed in cervical explants exposed to macrophage tropic strain HIV1Ba-L. HIV-infected cells were located in submucosa and had the morphology and distribution of macrophages. While CD4+/CD3+ T cells were still present at day 7 in the organ culture tissue, no infection of cervical explants was seen with T cell tropic strains even in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin and IL2. This model system will enable study of the dynamics of HIV infection of the human cervix and analysis of possible prophylactic or therapeutic strategies.\",\"We have examined the influence of the V1/V2 region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 on certain biologic properties of the virus. We observed that on the genomic background of the T-cell-line-tropic strain, HIV-1SF2mc, both the V1 and V2 domains of the macrophage-tropic strain, HIV-1SF162mc, in addition to the required V3 domain, are necessary to attain full macrophage tropism. Furthermore, the V2 domain modulates the sensitivity of HIV-1 to soluble CD4 neutralization. Structural studies of recombinant and mutant envelope glycoproteins suggest that the function of the V1/V2 region is to interact with the V3 domain and confer on the envelope gp120 of HIV-1SF2mc a conformation more similar to that of the macrophage-tropic strain HIV-1SF162mc. The conformation of the envelope gp120 appears to be strain specific and plays an important role in determining HIV-1 tissue tropism and sensitivity to soluble CD4 neutralization.\",\"Selective tropism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for cells with CD4 receptors and especially for TH lymphocytes--key cells in hematopoiesis--has from the clinico-biologic point of view a great many hematologic manifestations of which knowledge is essential for a good diagnosis and treatment as well as for a judicious estimation of prognosis. Thus the study presents the hematologic entities specifically associated with HIV infection (such as ITP, NHML) as well as the hematologic entities associated with HIV infection without presenting a causal relationship with the latter. The study also discusses the quantitative and morphologic changes of peripheral blood and of bone marrow often enlightening for the disease and its complications. An important chapter in the study is devoted to the hematologic changes induced by the HIV infection therapy as well as by the manners of therapeutic approach to the complex hematologic problems raised by the disease.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) external envelope glycoprotein gp120 tightly binds CD4 as its principal cellular receptor, explaining the tropism of HIV-1 for CD4+ cells. Nevertheless, reports documenting HIV infection or HIV binding in cells lacking CD4 surface expression have raised the possibility that cellular receptors in addition to CD4 may interact with HIV envelope. Moreover, the lymphocyte adhesion molecule LFA-1 appears to play an important role in augmenting HIV-1 viral spread and cytopathicity in vitro, although the mechanism of this function is still not completely defined. In the course of characterizing a human anti-HIV gp41 monoclonal antibody, we transfected a CD4-negative, LFA-1-negative B-cell line to express an anti-gp41 immunoglobulin receptor (surface immunoglobulin [sIg]/gp41). Despite acquiring the ability to bind HIV envelope, such transfected B cells could not be infected by HIV-1. These cells were not intrinsically defective for supporting HIV-1 infection, because when directed to produce surface CD4 by using retroviral constructs, they acquired the ability to replicate HIV-1. Interestingly, transfected cells expressing both surface CD4 and sIg/gp41 receptors replicated HIV much better than cells expressing only CD4. The enhancement resided specifically in sIg/gp41, because isotype-specific, anti-IgG1 antibodies directed against sIg/gp41 blocked the enhancement. These data directly establish the ability of a cell surface anti-gp41 receptor to enhance HIV-1 replication.\",\"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is prevalent in the human population, with primary infection occurring early in life. Its predominant CD4+ T-lymphocyte tropism, its ability to activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression in vitro, and its upregulation of CD4 expression has led to speculation that HHV-6 may act as a positive cofactor in the progression of HIV infection to AIDS in individuals infected with both viruses. Previous sequencing studies of restricted regions of the 161.5-kbp genome of HHV-6 have demonstrated unequivocally that it is a member of the betaherpesvirus subgroup and have indicated that the HHV-6 genome is generally collinear with the unique long (UL) component of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In the work described in this report we have extended these sequencing studies by determining the primary structure of 38.5-kbp of the HHV-6 genome (genomic position 21.0 to 59.5 kbp). Within the sequenced region lie 31 open reading frames, 20 of which are homologous to positional counterparts in HCMV. Of particular significance is the identification of homologs of the HCMV UL36-38 and US22-type genes, which have been shown to encode transactivating proteins. We show that DNA sequences encoding these HHV-6 homologs were able to transactivate HIV-1 long terminal repeat-directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in cotransfection assays, thus demonstrating functional as well as structural conservation of these betaherpesvirus-specific gene products. Our data therefore confirm the close relationship between HHV-6 and HCMV and identify putative immediate-early regulatory genes of HHV-6 likely to play key roles in lytic replication and possibly also in the interactions between HHV-6 and HIV in dually infected cells.\",\"The ability of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates to replicate in MT-2 cells was investigated as a prognostic marker for disease progression and CD4+ lymphocyte depletion in 53 HIV-1-infected, asymptomatic individuals. MT-2-negative viruses were isolated from 49% of the patients both early and late during the follow-up period; 38% converted from being MT-2 negative to MT-2 positive, while 11% were MT-2 positive throughout the study. One individual showed a fluctuating virus phenotype. The loss of CD4+ lymphocytes was significantly more rapid in MT-2-positive patients. We found a broad spectrum of CD4+ lymphocyte changes in patients whose virus changed its MT-2 tropism. Our data suggest that the changes could be divided into three general patterns. A stable or slowly decreasing CD4+ lymphocyte count changed into a more rapid fall in 44% of the patients, no significant change in rate of decline could be noted in 44% of the patients, while a stable CD4+ lymphocyte level after a change in MT-2 tropism was noted in 12% of the patients. A correlation between MT-2 tropism and clinical symptoms was also noted. Half of the patients with MT-2-negative virus throughout the study were still asymptomatic after a mean follow-up time of 80 months, while only 15% of those who converted remained asymptomatic. All patients with MT-2-positive viruses at the time of inclusion in the study developed HIV-1-related symptoms, and half of them died during the study. The MT-2 status of 16 patients, could be determined at the time of AIDS diagnosis; 50% were Mt-2 positive, while 50% were MT-2 negative. No difference in AIDS-defining diagnoses or CD4+ lymphocyte counts at the time of diagnosis was noted. Knowledge of the HIV-1 phenotype may improve the early recognition of progressive disease.\",\"Considerable controversy and uncertainty have surrounded the biological function of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 nef gene product. Initial studies suggested that this early, nonstructural viral protein functioned as a negative regulatory factor; thus, it was proposed to play a role in establishing or maintaining viral latency. In contrast, studies in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)mac-infected rhesus monkeys have suggested that Nef is not a negative factor but rather plays a central role in promoting high-level viral replication and is required for viral pathogenesis in vivo. We sought to define a tissue culture system that would approximate the in vivo setting for virus infection in order to assess the role of HIV-1 Nef in viral replication. We show that infection of mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with Nef+ HIV results in enhanced replication as evidenced by earlier gag p24 expression when compared with infections performed with nef mutant viruses. Moreover, when unstimulated freshly isolated PBMC are infected with Nef+ and Nef- viruses and then subsequently activated with mitogen, the Nef-induced difference in viral replication kinetics is even more pronounced, with the Nef- viruses requiring much more time in culture for appreciable growth. A positive effect of Nef on viral replication was also observed in primary macrophages infected with a recombinant of YU-2, a patient-derived molecular clone with macrophage tropism. These positive effects of Nef on viral replication are dependent on the initial multiplicity of infection (MOI), in that infections of unstimulated PBMC at low MOI are most dependent upon intact nef for subsequent viral growth. We now provide evidence that the Nef+ HIV is more infectious than Nef- HIV from both a tissue culture infectious dose analysis, and a single-cell HIV infection assay. In the latter case, we demonstrate that infection with equivalent doses of HIV based on virion-associated gag p24 yields five- to sixfold more infected cells if Nef+ viral stocks were used. Furthermore, we find that the differential infectivity is not dependent on CD4 down-regulation as Nef+ virus produced from transfected COS cells lacking CD4 is also more infectious. However, normalization of PBMC infections to equivalent infectivity between that of the Nef+ and Nef- viruses continues to reveal delayed viral replication in the absence of Nef, suggesting that secondary viral spread in PBMC is also enhanced in Nef+ infections. We demonstrate this directly by showing a 13-15-fold increase in infectivity of PBMC-derived Nef+ HIC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\",\"As described above, monocytes/macrophages from such diverse areas as the CNS, lungs, peripheral blood, cord blood, and liver are susceptible to infection by HIV-1 and may serve as reservoirs for transmitting the virus throughout the body. In contrast to lymphocytes, the chronic and low-level mode of infection that HIV-1 takes on within monocytes/macrophages allows these cells to contribute to persistent viral infection. Infection of these cells by HIV-1 can alter a variety of their immunological functions such as cytokine production, chemotaxis, accessory cell function, and microbicidal activity. Furthermore, macrophages and macrophage-related microglial cells in the brain and CSF are thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CNS disease. Infection with HIV-1 in monocytes/macrophages is regulated in an autocrine manner by a panel of cytokines and other soluble factors. Most HIV-1 isolates exhibit specific tropism for monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, or, in some cases, both cell types; this phenomenon of tropism may be linked to structural variabilities between different isolates. While in vitro studies clearly demonstrate that the replicating cycle of HIV-1 in monocytes/macrophages differs from its replicating cycle in lymphocytes, elucidation of the role of monocyte/macrophages in mediating the severe immunosuppression characteristic of AIDS is far more from complete, and further investigation into the role of monocytes/macrophages in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection is necessary to design therapeutic approaches to control viral infection and disease progression.\",\"Determinants responsible for HIV-1 infection of T lymphoid cell lines were identified by functional analysis of chimeric proviral clones derived from T-cell line tropic-(HXB2) and non-T-cell line-tropic isolates (YU2, ADA). Replacement of the HXB2 V3 envelope loop sequence with that derived from YU2 resulted in a virus that is no longer T cell line-tropic. However, the reciprocal replacement using HXB2 V3 loop sequences did not confer upon either ADA or YU2 envelope proteins the ability to infect T cell lines. Furthermore, the resultant viruses were incapable of infection of primary lymphocytes. Single, double, and multiple point mutations made within the V3 loop sequence did not result in change in tropism, although mutations involving residue 275 resulted in a virus that was incapable of infecting primary lymphocytes but retained the ability to infect Jurkat T lymphoid cells. These results suggest that the V3 envelope determinant is necessary for T cell line infection, but other determinant(s) in envelope are also necessary to obtain infectious virus expression.\",\"Concern that ADE of HIV infection could occur in vivo, as a result of HIV immunization, has arisen for several reasons. Immune-mediated disease enhancement occurs in several human and animal viral diseases, including lentiviral diseases. Tropism for host M/M cells is a common characteristic in these diseases. Sera from naturally infected, and possibly HIV-immunized, individuals have been shown to contain infection enhancing antibodies in vitro. Finally, there is considerable genetic, and potentially antigenic, diversity among HIV-1 isolates. This workshop was convened to evaluate these concerns regarding ADE of HIV infection in human HIV vaccine trials and to propose studies that would address this potential risk. Although there is currently no evidence that immune-mediated enhancement of disease occurs in HIV, there is clearly a need for carefully designed experiments to further evaluate this issue. As there are several notable diseases for which in vitro ADE does not correlate with ADE in vivo, in vitro data are insufficient to deter development of current HIV-1 vaccine candidates. In vivo correlates of protection/enhancement are necessary to evaluate the ADE risk accurately. The development of an HIV animal model that would allow testing of vaccine candidates is of primary importance.\",\"In a series of 97 infants born to mothers who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 18 were identified as infected within the first 60 days of life on the basis of viral culture and polymerase chain reaction findings. We studied viral burden in vivo by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the in vitro replication pattern of the HIV-1 infecting strain by culturing patient cells with normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. According to the lag phase before p24 antigen detection and the level of p24 production on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 isolates from these patients were classified as rapid/high (R/H), slow/high (S/H), and slow/low (S/L). The pattern of HIV-1 replication in vitro was significantly associated with the viral burden in vivo; the range of HIV-1 copies per 10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 10 to 38, 44 to 314, and 360 to 947 in children with isolates of the S/L, S/H, and R/H types, respectively. Viral tropism was assessed by culturing patient cells under end-point dilution conditions with either CD4+ T-lymphocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that children with S/L isolates harbored mainly monocytotropic variants; all infants with S/H or R/H isolates had T-lymphotropic variants and, in 7 of 11 cases, monocytotropic or amphitropic variants. All children with R/H isolates had HIV-related symptoms by the age of 4 months, and five had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by the age of 1 year. At 1 year of age, four and no infants with S/H or S/L isolates, respectively, had HIV-1-related symptoms (p < 0.001), and none had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (p = 0.006).\",\"To investigate the mechanism underlying one aspect of the cellular tropism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we used a macrophage-tropic isolate, 89.6, and screened its ability to infect a number of continuous cell lines. HIV-1 (89.6) was able to replicate robustly in a T-cell/B-cell hybrid line, CEMx174, while it replicated modestly or not at all in either of its parents, one of which is the CD4-positive line CEM.3. Analysis by transfection of a molecular clone, a virus uptake assay, and polymerase chain reaction all provided strong evidence that the block to HIV-1(89.6) replication in the CEM.3 line lies at the level of cellular entry. These results were complemented by preparing a CD4-expressing derivative of the B-cell parent, 721.174, and demonstrating that it is permissive for productive HIV-1(89.6) replication. Given these experimental findings, we speculate that there exist cellular accessory factors which facilitate virus entry and infection in CD4-positive cells. Furthermore, these cellular accessory factors may be quite virus strain specific, since not all macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 were able to replicate in the CEMx174 hybrid cell line. This experimental model provides a system for the identification of one or more of these putative cellular accessory factors.\",\"No predictive parameters of in utero or perinatal vertical transmission of HIV to newborns are known at present. Vertical transmission may be related to several biological parameters of maternal HIV infection: (1) immunological parameters (neutralizing antibodies); (2) the concentration of viral particles and/or infected cells; and (3) the selection of HIV subspecies of particular cellular tropism. The present study was designed to examine the relationship between cellular viral burden and transmission, and between maternal viral burden and CD4+ cell count and clinical status at delivery. We investigated mother-to-infant HIV-1 transmission at delivery in a cohort of 51 pairs of mothers and newborns. Twelve infants were HIV-infected, as determined by successive polymerase chain reaction and culture determinations within the first 6 months of life, and nine of these were diagnosed as HIV-infected during the first week of life. We determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell proviral DNA burden using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in the HIV-1 gag gene, using [32P]-end-labelled primers. External standard DNA samples were from the 85-14 F2 cell line, which contains a unique defective proviral DNA genome. There was a linear relationship between the logarithms of c.p.m. and the number of HIV-1 DNA copies. We have previously reported that the number of HIV provirus copies in maternal blood cells is related to transmission of the virus. Quantification of the HIV provirus by polymerase chain reaction may be used as a predictive parameter of vertical transmission if accompanied by an exhaustive clinical and biological follow-up during pregnancy.\",\"The fourth conserved region (C4) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) surface glycoprotein has been shown to participate in CD4 binding and to influence viral tropism (A. Cordonnier, L. Montagnier, and M. Emerman, Nature [London] 340:571-574, 1989). To define the role of the corresponding region of HIV-2, we introduce single amino acid changes into the C4 sequence of HIV-2ROD. The effects of these mutations on glycoprotein function and on virus infectivity have been examined. We have shown that the tryptophan residue at position 428 is necessary primarily for CD4 binding. The isoleucine residue at position 421 is necessary for the establishment of productive infection in the promonocytic cell line U937, while it is dispensable to some extent for infection of primary T lymphocytes or the lymphocytic cell line SUP-T1. This replication defect correlated with the failure of the Ile-421-to-Thr (Ile-421-->Thr) mutant glycoprotein to form syncytia in U937 cells. DNA analysis of revertant viruses revealed that a strong selective pressure was exerted on residue 421 of the surface glycoprotein to allow HIV-2 infection of U937 cells. These results demonstrate that this region of HIV-2 plays an important role in determining fusion efficiency in a cell-dependent manner and consequently can influence viral tropism.\",\"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vif gene (viral infectivity gene) plays an important role in viral replication in vitro. We demonstrated that the Vif protein is membrane associated in HIV-1-infected cells and have investigated the role in viral replication of the equivalent gene in HIV-2. We constructed an HIV-2 vif minus mutant and studied its virulence and cellular tropism in vitro. Parallel experiments were also performed with an HIV-1 vif mutant to ascertain whether the two distantly related HIV-2 and HIV-1 genes might exert the same effect on viral replication. The results indicated that both HIV-1 and HIV-2 vif minus cell-free infection was not impaired when the SupT-1 cell line was used. However, differential degrees of impairment in viral replication were observed when other cell lines were used (Molt-3, U-937). Nevertheless, when viral production could not be detected, rescue experiments by coculture with the permissive cell line SupT-1 were generally positive, indicating that the viruses were still present in the inoculated cells. In contrast, when primary human cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified macrophages) were infected with HIV-1 and HIV-2 vif minus viruses no productive infection was observed and generally no virus was rescued by cocultivation. Thus, like in HIV-1, the vif gene of HIV-2 is crucial for viral infectivity in primary cells and might represent an attractive target for therapy.\",\"The envelope protein is an important determinant of HIV-1 cell-specific tropism. The gp160 envelope precursor proteins from macrophage-tropic or T lymphoid cell line-tropic strains of HIV-1 were expressed in recombinant vaccinia virus-infected cell lines or primary lymphocytes or macrophages. No significant differences in the kinetics of synthesis of gp160, processing into gp120 and gp41 proteins, N-linked glycosylation, or release of gp120 into the medium were noted with the different envelope proteins. However, gp120 envelope protein shed into the medium was found to be at least partially cleaved at a site within the V3 loop. The gp120 envelope proteins from macrophage-tropic isolates exhibited lower rates of cleavage than those from lymphoid cell line-tropic strains in all cell types examined. Cell-free protease digestion studies also demonstrated relative resistance of the envelopes from macrophage-tropic compared to lymphoid cell line-tropic strains. All recombinant envelope proteins were recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed at gp41 or the C-terminal gp120 epitopes, and no differences in binding to CD4 were noted.\",\"Two different states of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 are apparent in the asymptomatic and late stages of infection. Important determinants associated with these two states have been found within the V3 loop of the viral Env protein. In this study, two large data sets of published V3 sequences were analyzed to identify patterns of sequence variability that would correspond to these two states of the virus. We were especially interested in the pattern of basic amino acid substitutions, since the presence of basic amino acids in V3 has been shown to change virus tropism in cell culture. Four features of the sequence heterogeneity in V3 were observed: (i) approximately 70% of all nonconservative basic substitutions occur at four positions in V3, and V3 sequences with a basic substitution in at least one of these four positions contain approximately 95% of all nonconservative basic substitutions; (ii) substitution patterns within V3 are influenced by the identity of the amino acid at position 25; (iii) sequence polymorphisms account for a significant fraction of uncharged amino acid substitutions at several positions in V3, and sequence heterogeneity other than these polymorphisms is most significant at two positions near the tip of V3; and (iv) sequence heterogeneity in V3 (in addition to the basic amino acid substitutions) is approximately twofold greater in V3 sequences that contain basic amino acid substitutions. By using this sequence analysis, we were able to identify distinct groups of V3 sequences in infected patients that appear to correspond to these two virus states. The identification of these discrete sequence patterns in vivo demonstrates how the V3 sequence can be used as a genetic marker for studying the two states of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.\",\"The human T cell leukemia virus II (HTLV-II) is a type C retrovirus closely related to the human transforming retrovirus HTLV-I. In contrast to HTLV-I, the role of HTLV-II in human disease is controversial. However, HTLV-II infection has been documented in several cases of a clinically benign hairy cell leukemia and has also been suggested as a cofactor for HIV-1 disease progression. We report that an HTLV-II isolate (designated FLW) derived from a serum-positive white male can induce cell fusion and significant cytopathic effects in tissue culture. This HTLV-II isolate induced syncytium formation with human T and B cell lines, several human fibroblast cell lines, and, interestingly, HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected cell lines. To elucidate the role in the FLW envelope in this phenomenon, we have cloned the envelope glycoproteins gp46 and gp21 of this isolate. The envelope glycoproteins expressed in the absence of the rest of the viral genome were sufficient to drive syncytium formation in vitro, and preserved the cellular tropism for syncytium formation observed with the native retroviral isolate. Amino acid (aa) sequence analysis demonstrated 88% overall similarity with other HTLV-II envelope glycoproteins. Interestingly, only cells infected by HIV-I, but not parental H9 cells, form syncytia with FLW env-transfected cells as well as with HTLV-II/FLW-infected BJAB-WH cells. Furthermore, antibodies directed at the CD4 receptor failed to inhibit the induction of giant cell formation, implying that the FLW envelope protein was responsible for driving syncytium formation in this system. These observations may be important for the understanding of the processes involved in human retroviral-mediated syncytium formation and may suggest a mechanism whereby HTLV-II could influence the disease process in individuals dually infected with HIV-1 and HTLV-II.\",\"To identify and characterize individuals with long-term HIV-1 infection who have experienced little or no progressive CD4+ T-cell loss during follow-up. The rate of CD4+ T-cell loss (CD4 slope) was determined for each of the 290 participants in the San Francisco Men's Health Study who were seropositive at study entry in 1984. The study population was stratified, by CD4 slope, into 10 groups of 29 individuals and each group was characterized using a variety of cross-sectional and longitudinal laboratory measurements. Approximately 10% of the HIV-1-infected men experienced no net CD4+ T-cell loss during 78 months of follow-up. Compared with all other seropositive subjects, these 'non-progressors' were the extreme cases in a relatively continuous distribution of CD4 slopes, rather than a discrete subpopulation. Although they had no net cell loss, their mean CD4+ cell count was approximately 400 x 10(6)/l lower and their mean CD8+ cell count approximately 250 x 10(6)/l higher than seronegative subjects, suggesting early changes followed by stabilization. The CD4 slope was associated with the levels of beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin, p24 antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, viral burden, and the proportion of HIV-1 isolates with tropism for the MT-2 T-cell line. Multivariate cluster analysis of these laboratory markers did not distinguish the non-progressors as a distinct subgroup. These findings support both a biphasic natural history and the suggestion that the broad range in HIV disease progression rates may be the result of several independent factors interacting in a variety of combinations. Recent changes in laboratory markers, known to predict both CD4+ cell loss and AIDS, suggest that non-progressors are undergoing slow HIV disease progression.\",\"Pulmonary disease is a frequent manifestation in the terminal stages of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and is caused mainly by a number of opportunistic microorganisms, most commonly Pneumocystis carinii. Despite the extensive involvement of the lung in the pathogenesis of AIDS, until recently little was known about the role of human immunodeficiency (HIV). In this review we will discuss the cellular tropism and phenotypic characterisation of HIV strains isolated from the lung. The available literature on HIV infection of the lung is reviewed, and the mechanisms of HIV-induced pathogenesis in the lung is discussed.\",\"Multiple targets for immune recognition and cellular tropism are localized to the V1 and V2 hypervariable regions in the amino portion of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120env. We have assessed genetic diversity in env V1 and V2 hypervariable domains in vivo within epidemiologically related strains of HIV-1. Our strategy was to analyze longitudinal samples from two seropositive mothers and multiple children infected by perinatal transmission. Although the V1 and V2 domains are closely linked in the HIV-1 genome, nucleotide sequences in V1 and in V2 evolved independently in maternal-infant viruses in vivo. A high proportion of the nucleotide substitutions would introduce amino acid diversity in V1 and in V2. A significant excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions was identified in HIV-1 env V1 and V2 peptides in the mothers and in two older children but was not generally apparent in HIV-1 sequences in infants. An excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions indicated that there is positive selection for independent genetic variation in the V1 and V2 domains in vivo. It is likely that there are host responses to complex determinants in the V1 or V2 hypervariable domain of HIV-1 gp120.\",\"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is a potent transcriptional trans activator of the viral long terminal repeat promoter element. Tat function requires the direct interaction of Tat with a cis-acting viral RNA target sequence termed the trans-activation response (TAR) element and has also been proposed to require at least one cellular cofactor. We have used a genetic approach to attempt to experimentally define the role of the cellular cofactor in Tat function and TAR binding. Our data suggest that neither Tat nor the cellular cofactor binds to TAR alone in vivo and indicate, instead, that the interaction of Tat with its cellular cofactor is a prerequisite for TAR binding. The known species tropism of lentivirus Tat proteins appears to arise from the fact that not only Tat but also the cellular cofactor can markedly influence the RNA sequence specificity of the resultant protein complex. These data also suggest that the Tat cofactor is likely a cellular transcription factor that has been highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. We hypothesize that the primary function of Tat is to redirect this cellular factor to a novel viral RNA target site and to thereby induce activation of viral gene expression.\",\"The expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is enhanced after cell activation because of the interaction of cell-encoded nuclear factors that interact with binding sites in the long terminal repeats (LTRs). Here we studied the contribution of cell type-specific activation signals to differences in cytotropism of HIV-1 variants. Four closely related molecular HIV-1 clones with distinct biological phenotypes and different capacities to replicate in primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) or T cell lines were used. Sequence analysis of these LTRs revealed variation in functionally important regions. Adaptation of virus variants to particular host cells by differences in LTR responsiveness was analyzed. LTR-CAT constructs were transiently transfected in T cells that were stimulated with T cell-specific activation signals such as combinations of anti-CD3 or anti-CD28 MoAB or in primary monocytes that were stimulated with IL-3, IL-4, or GM-CSF. No differences in responsiveness to cell type-specific signals were demonstrated. To further elucidate the level of restriction in cell tropism, transfection of four full-length infectious molecular HIV-1 clones into 5-day cultured MDMs was performed. From all clones, competent virus could be rescued from MDMs by coculture with PHA-stimulated PBLs. However, following cell-free inoculation, proviral DNA could be detected by PCR analysis only in monocytes exposed to HIV-1 clones that previously were shown to establish productive infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\"The third variable domain (V3 domain) of HIV-1 gp120 is involved in virus neutralization by antibody, in determination of cell tropism, and in syncytium-inducing/non-syncytium-inducing capacity. Antibodies are highly specific tools to delineate the role of different V3 amino acid sequences in these processes, and to dissect events occurring during synthesis of gp120/160, gp120-CD4 interaction, cellular infection, and syncytium formation. We describe here an IgG1 murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), coded IIIB-V3-01, that was raised with a synthetic peptide (FVTIGKIGNMRQAHC) derived from the carboxy-terminal flank of the HIV-1 IIIB V3 domain. The binding site of this antibody was mapped to the sequence IGKIGNMRQ, using Pepscan analysis. In ELISA, this antibody binds to E. coli-derived gp120 from HIV-1 IIIB, which is denatured and not glycosylated. The antibody showed no neutralizing activity against HIV-1 IIIB, MN, SF2, or RF in a virus neutralization assay and in a syncytium formation inhibition assay. In addition, this antibody did not react with gp120 expressed on the surface of IIIB-infected MOLT-3 cells in FACS analysis. To assess whether the epitope defined by MAb IIIB-V3-01 is hidden on native gp120, reactivity of the antibody with SDS-DTT-denatured or DTT-denatured glycosylated gp120 (CHO cell produced) was tested. Both these treatments exposed the epitope for binding. From these data we conclude that the epitope defined by MAB IIIB-V3-01 is hidden on glycosylated recombinant gp120, and is not accessible on gp120 expressed on the membrane of HIV-1, IIIB-infected cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\",\"Dendritic cells (DC) are members of a distinct family of bone marrow-derived leukocytes. DC are potent accessory cells for a number of T cell-mediated immune responses, including autologous and allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions, and mitogen- and antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. In the present study, DC purified from human peripheral blood were inoculated with various strains (IIIB, SF2, WMJ1, SF162, 89.6 and clone HXB2) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) displaying different patterns of cellular tropism. Viral replication was demonstrated by detection of p24 antigen (Ag) intracellularly and in culture supernatants, and by Southern and Northern blot analyses for the presence of HIV DNA and RNA, respectively, within infected cells. Cell-free and cell-associated p24 Ag levels rose substantially when DC were inoculated with strains SF162, 89.6 and clone HXB2. In contrast, p24 Ag levels rose only marginally after inoculation of DC with strains IIIB, SF2 and WMJ1. Purified DC did not express detectable membrane CD4, although CD4 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR. The presence of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies failed to block infection of DC by any of the HIV strains tested, suggesting the existence of a CD4-independent alternative pathway of viral entry. The possibility that DC serve as a reservoir for HIV-1 must be considered.\",\"Specific point mutations which affect viral tropism have been identified in both the V3 loop and in the CD4-binding region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 surface glycoprotein gp120. Here we report that a single point mutation in the first variable region (V1) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain JRCSF is responsible for a change in viral tropism.\",\"Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples collected from five individuals during the period of viremia before seroconversion in primary infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Nucleotide sequence analysis of amplified DNA from the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions indicated that the initial virus population of each acutely infected individual was completely homogeneous in sequence. No intrasample variability was found among the 44,090 nucleotides sequenced in this region of env, contrasting with the high degree of variability normally found in seropositive individuals. Paradoxically, substantial sequence variability was found in the normally high conserved gag gene (encoding p17) in most of the preseroconversion samples. The diversity of p17 sequences in samples that were homogeneous in V3 and V4 can most readily be explained by the existence of strong selection for specific env sequences either upon transmission or in the interval between exposure and seroconversion in the exposed individual. Evidence that localizes the selected region upon transmission to V3 is provided by the similarity or identity of V3 loop sequences in five individuals with epidemiologically unrelated HIV-1 infections, while regions flanking the V3 loop and the V4 hypervariable region were highly divergent. The actual V3 sequences were similar to those associated with macrophage tropism in primary isolates of HIV, irrespective of whether infection was acquired by sexual contact or parenterally through transfusion of contaminated factor VIII. Proviral DNA sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained homogeneous in the V3 and V4 regions (and variable in p17gag) for several months after seroconversion. The persistence of HIV sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells identical to those found at primary infection in the absence of continued virus expression provides an explanation for the previously observed differences in the composition of circulating DNA and RNA populations in sequential samples from seropositive individuals.\",\"Human peripheral blood T lymphocytes are readily transformed to continuous growth by Herpesvirus saimiri subgroup C strains. The immortalized cells express the phenotype of mature activated T cells and bear either CD4 or CD8 surface markers. Here we report that Herpesvirus saimiri transformed CD4+ cell lines are highly susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2. The prototype viruses HIV-1IIIB and HIV-2ROD replicated rapidly and caused cell death within 14 days. These cell lines did also support growth of a poorly replicating HIV-2 strain (HIV-2NEP) and of primary clinical isolates. Thus H. saimiri transformed T cells represent a new system for HIV propagation and isolation, especially for HIV-2 strains with restricted cell tropism. These cells should be considered as an alternative approach in cases where conventional attempts fail.\",\"As part of a general program investigating the mechanism of the Rev axis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) autoregulation, a series of proviral HIV-1 mutants which differ from the parental HXB2 strain at selected positions within the RRE were constructed. All of the mutations were designed to perturb the RRE by introducing local helix disruptions without altering the coding potential of the overlapping envelope open reading frame. Viral replication in various cell types was monitored by a cell supernatant reverse transcriptase assay and Northern (RNA blot) analysis. All proviral RRE mutants displayed at least some impairment in replication. However, the relative impairment varied drastically among the various cell types tested. This suggests that the RRE may contribute to cell-type-specific viral tropism.\",\"The V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 is an important determinant of HIV-1-specific cell tropism. Nine different purified envelope proteins were prepared in order to examine the association between the structure of the gp120 proteins and functional properties of HIV-1 virions differing in their tropism for T-cell lines and macrophages. Six monoclonal antibodies to the V3 loop reacted preferentially with T-cell line-tropic gp120 envelope proteins, and one monoclonal antibody reacted preferentially with macrophage-tropic gp120 envelope proteins. T-cell line-tropic gp120 envelope proteins were at least 10-fold more susceptible to V3 loop proteolytic cleavage by human thrombin, and 1000-fold more susceptible to V3 loop proteolytic cleavage by human mast cell tryptase than macrophage-tropic gp120 envelope proteins. These findings suggest that there are two distinct conformations for the V3 loop of T-cell line-tropic and macrophage-tropic gp120 envelope proteins.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates differ in cell tropism, replication, pathogenicity, and syncytial induction in vitro. CD4+ T cells were enumerated in severe combined immunodeficient mice transplanted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (hu-PBL-SCID mice) and infected with HIV isolates with different in vitro cytopathicity. Two noncytopathic, macrophage-tropic strains, HIV-1SF162 and HIV-2UC1, induced extensive CD4+ T cell depletion, whereas HIV-1SF33, which is highly cytopathic for T cells in vitro, caused little CD4+ T cell depletion at equivalent virus burden. In vitro cytopathicity assays therefore do not predict CD4 depletion in the hu-PBL-SCID model.\",\"To investigate the expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genes in human monocytes, a DNA transfection system was developed and characterized using cultured primary monocytes. Monocytes that were cultured 6-7 days in an adherent monolayer were efficiently recovered and transfected by electroporation with an expression vector containing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. Successful transfection was detected by expression of beta-galactosidase activity and by histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase in cells that were allowed to readhere to plastic following transfection. Over 30% of the surviving adherent monocytes expressed the transfected beta-galactosidase gene. In the same manner, monocytes were transfected with HIV provirus clones pIIIB and pIIB/PB. The provirus pIIIB/PB differs from pIIIB only in that it contains a small sequence from the env gene of a macrophage tropic HIV-1. Virus derived from pIIIB will not replicate in monocytes whereas virus derived from pIIIB/PB will. Monocytes transfected with either provirus DNA expressed high levels of p24 antigen within 1 day of transfection, and cell-free supernatants contained virus that was infectious for T cells. In contrast, only supernatants from pIIIB/PB transfections contained virus capable of infecting monocytes. Thus, proviral DNA of T cell tropic HIV efficiently completes the retroviral life cycle in monocytes in a manner indistinguishable from that of macrophage tropic HIV, and progeny virus retain their T cell tropism.\",\"Seven infectious molecular clones were obtained from a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolate with rapid/high replicative capacity. Biological characterization of progeny viruses obtained after transfection of clones into peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that six clones yielded virus with restricted cell tropism, whereas one clone yielded virus able to replicate in cell lines. Although transfection of each of the clones 12, 13, and 82 individually gave rise to viruses with restricted tropism, viruses recovered from cotransfection of the mixtures of these clones exhibited altered phenotype, inasmuch as they were able to replicate in cell lines. To test whether recombination and/or complementation has taken place in the mixture of clones 12 + 13 + 82, the progeny virus was diluted to end point in 15 parallel series. Viruses with diverse biological phenotypes were recovered. With the help of distinctive restriction enzyme markers in regions comprising the vpu/env junction and variable regions 4 and 5 (V4/V5) of the env gene, recombinant genotypes could be identified with high frequency. No particular biological phenotype could be linked to a certain genotype in this study. The results show that different coexisting variants may interact and thereby influence the biological phenotype of a viral population.\",\"The prototypic macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolate, HIV-1BaL, cannot replicate in the monocytoid cell line THP-1. After induction of differentiation by a phorbol diester, a fraction of THP-1 cells became permissive to HIV-1BaL. In contrast, this treatment decreased permissiveness for the lymphotropic isolate HIV-1LAI. Viral DNA was not synthesized in unstimulated THP-1 cells, as determined with PCR, suggesting that the block to HIV-1BaL replication in these cells occurred at an early step of the virus replicative cycle prior to or at the level of reverse transcription. Virus binding studies showed that differences in cell permissiveness for HIV-1BaL were not due to altered virus binding. Substantial amounts of HIV-1BaL bound to both undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells, and this binding could not be prevented by blocking with the anti-CD4 antibody Leu3a, which did prevent the binding of HIV-1LAI to CEM T lymphoid cells. While Leu3a was very effective at preventing the infection by HIV-1LAI in CEM cells, it was less effective in preventing HIV-1BaL infection of differentiated THP-1 cells or primary macrophages. Although it is likely that molecules other than CD4 on monocytic cells can mediate binding of macrophage-tropic HIV, the binding of HIV-1BaL to THP-1 cells was not sufficient for infection, because binding was the same in nonpermissive undifferentiated cells as in permissive differentiated cells. Thus, the restriction of viral replication in this model cell system occurs at some step after virion binding. Comparison of differentiated THP-1 cells with their undifferentiated counterparts may provide an approach to defining cellular determinants of HIV host range other than CD4 expression and to characterizing the incompletely defined steps of viral entry.\",\"The mechanisms of HIV infection of target cells are described. Particularly the role of three types of cell receptors, which participate in the process of virus-cell interactions: CD4 protein, receptor for Fc fragment of antibodies and complement receptors are discussed. The variability of the virus variants, which determines the virus tropism and cytotoxic properties towards specific cell types is stressed.\",\"It has been suggested that the V3 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates has to interact with a cell-surface-associated or endosomal proteinase during virus entry into susceptible cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the effect of several mutations in the V3 loop on its susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage by thrombin and cathepsin E and compared it with the effect of these mutations on viral infectivity. The data obtained indicate that, if an interaction between the V3 loop and a proteinase is indeed crucial for viral entry, the substrate requirements for such a proteinase(s) would have to be very complex. In particular, it seems unlikely that a single enzyme with a unique specificity would be able to interact with all of the different HIV-1 and HIV-2/SIV strains isolated so far. Therefore, one would have to postulate the involvement of several cellular proteinases, or proteases with multiple specificities, in V3-based viral tropism.\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"This study examines some technical aspects of the transmission to and permanent adaptability in continuous cell lines of wild HIV-1 isolates. Three cell systems (the lymphocytic cell lines Molt-3 and H-9 and the monocytoid cell line U-937) and two transmission protocols (cell to cell and cell-free) were used. Two different replicative behaviours were observed among isolates efficiently transmitted: a) transmissibility but not adaptability (consisting in a limited length of viral replication); aa) transmissibility and adaptability (consisting in a stable and long term virus production). The second type of replication was confined to viruses from patients with severe immunodeficiency. Technical and viral factors can affect the rate of transmissibility and adaptability: the modality of infection (cell to cell transmission appeared to be the most efficient) and the tropism of the virus (some viruses could infect only one T cell line).\",\"The HIV1-PAR strain, isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an HIV1-seropositive man suffering from encephalopathy, replicated well in cord blood lymphocytes, poorly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and to different levels in blood-derived macrophage (BDM) cultures prepared from different blood donors. In marked contrast to its replication in primocultures, it did not grow in CEM and U937 cell lines. HIV1-PAR production in BDM was inhibited by more than 90% after treatment with OKT4A or 13B8.2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) binding to adjacent epitopes of the D1 domain of the CD4 molecules. A lower but significant inhibitory effect was observed after BDM treatment with BL4 and OKT4 mAb, directed to the D2 and D3 domain of the CD4 molecule, respectively. The entire HIV1-PAR envelope glycoprotein gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of HIV1-PAR gp160 revealed the presence of 847 amino acids and 86% homology with the HIV1 LAV virus prototype. An alignment of the amino acid sequence of the envelope glycoprotein of HIV1-PAR and HIV1-LAV showed that the differences were mostly clustered within the five variable regions. Five CD4-binding domains, the gp120/gp41 cleavage site, the putative gp41 fusion domain and 21 out of the 22 cysteine residues were conserved in both isolates. The results further confirm the macrophage-tropic character of the HIV1-PAR virus.\",\"Infection of the central nervous system by HIV-1, the agent of AIDS, is characterized by the presence of infected and giant microglial cells as well as astrocytosis, demyelination, and neuronal loss. To determine whether cells of neuroectoderm origin can be infected by HIV-1, we have inoculated primary cultures derived from adult human brain with a lymphotropic virus (LAV) or a neurotropic virus (Jr-FL) isolated from a patient with AIDS dementia. While Jr-FL invariably causes productive infection of cultured brain microglia, neither astrocytes nor oligodendrocytes became productively infected by these viral strains. Moreover, the cultured oligodendrocytes develop a normal network of processes and express differentiation antigens in the presence of an ongoing lytic infection of microglial cells. No HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected in primary astrocyte cultures devoid of microglial after inoculation of either HIV-1 strain. Similarly, the neuronal cell line HCN-1 in its differentiated state did not allow the virus to go through cycles of reverse transcription and replication. LAV, however, was able to replicate in undifferentiated HCN-1 cells. Thus, tropism of HIV-1 appears tightly restricted to only one type of differentiated cell in the CNS, the microglia.\",\"We isolated and molecularly cloned a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain (89.6) which is unusual because it is both macrophage-tropic and extremely cytopathic in lymphocytes. Moreover, this is the first well-characterized infectious molecularly cloned macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strain derived from peripheral blood. HIV-1 89.6 differs markedly from other macrophage-tropic isolates within the envelope V3 region, which is important in determining cell tropism and cytopathicity. HIV-1 89.6 may thus represent a transitional isolate between noncytopathic macrophage-tropic viruses and cytopathic lymphocyte-tropic viruses.\",\"Complement and antibody contribute to infection-enhancement and possible expanded cellular tropism of HIV-1 in vitro through a process requiring complement receptors. Until now, however, the ability of HIV-1 to bind complement receptors has not been documented or characterized. We investigated whether antibody and complement permitted HIV-1 to bind to the B lymphocyte receptor, CR2 (CD21), in an effort to learn more about infection-enhancement, and also because CR2 can mediate B cell proliferation and antigen localization in lymphoid organs in other systems. HIV-1 incubated with antibody and fresh human serum as a source of complement bound approximately 10-fold greater to cells expressing CR2 than to HIV-1-permissive cells lacking this receptor. A similar effect was observed using cells which expressed CR2 but no CD4. This binding was minimal in heat-inactivated and C3-deficient sera, and was significantly reduced by the anti-CR2 MoAb, OKB7, but not by the anti-CD4 MoAb, OKT4a. Thus, complement and antibody acted in concert to facilitate the binding of HIV-1 to CR2 independently of CD4. CD4-independent binding of HIV-1 to CR2 was not sufficient to produce infection in Raji-3 cells. Titres of antibodies mediating CR2 binding correlated with antibody titres as measured by immunofluorescence (P < 0.01) and infection-enhancement (P < 0.05) but were discordant with titres of neutralizing antibodies, a result consistent with the utilization of CR2 for enhanced infection of cells. The ability of complement and antibody to facilitate the binding of HIV-1 to CR2 in the absence of CD4 provides new insights into mechanisms of HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis and infection-enhancement.\",\"NaN\",\"Previous studies of the genetic and biologic characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have by necessity used tissue culture-derived virus. We recently reported the molecular cloning of four full-length HIV-1 genomes directly from uncultured human brain tissue (Y. Li, J. C. Kappes, J. A. Conway, R. W. Price, G. M. Shaw, and B. H. Hahn, J. Virol. 65:3973-3985, 1991). In this report, we describe the biologic properties of these four clones and the complete nucleotide sequences and genome organization of two of them. Clones HIV-1YU-2 and HIV-1YU-10 were 9,174 and 9,176 nucleotides in length, differed by 0.26% in nucleotide sequence, and except for a frameshift mutation in the pol gene in HIV-1YU-10, contained open reading frames corresponding to 5'-gag-pol-vif-vpr-tat-rev-vpu-env-nef-3' flanked by long terminal repeats. HIV-1YU-2 was fully replication competent, while HIV-1YU-10 and two other clones, HIV-1YU-21 and HIV-1YU-32, were defective. All three defective clones, however, when transfected into Cos-1 cells in any pairwise combination, yielded virions that were replication competent and transmissible by cell-free passage. The cellular host range of HIV-1YU-2 was strictly limited to primary T lymphocytes and monocyte-macrophages, a property conferred by its external envelope glycoprotein. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1YU-2 gene sequences revealed this virus to be a member of the North American/European HIV-1 subgroup, with specific similarity to other monocyte-tropic viruses in its V3 envelope amino acid sequence. These results indicate that HIV-1 infection of brain is characterized by the persistence of mixtures of fully competent, minimally defective, and more substantially altered viral forms and that complementation among them is readily attainable. In addition, the limited degree of genotypic heterogeneity observed among HIV-1YU and other brain-derived viruses and their preferential tropism for monocyte-macrophages suggest that viral replication within the central nervous system may differ from that within the peripheral lymphoid compartment in significant and clinically important ways. The availability of genetically and biologically well characterized HIV-1 clones from uncultured human tissue should facilitate future studies of virus-cell interactions relevant to viral pathogenesis and drug and vaccine development.\",\"Formation of large syncytia and rapid cell killing are characteristics of the Zairian human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolate HIV-1-NDK, which is highly cytopathic for CD4+ lymphocytes in comparison with the HIV-1-LAV prototype. Chimeric viruses containing different combinations of HIV-1-NDK genetic determinants corresponding to the splice donor, the packaging signal, and the coding sequence of the p18gag protein together with the HIV-1-NDK EcoRI5278-XhoI8401 fragment were obtained by polymerase chain reaction-directed recombination. Phenotypic analysis of recombinant viruses indicated that 75 amino acids from the N-terminal part of HIV-1-NDK p18gag protein together with the HIV-1-NDK envelope glycoprotein are responsible for enhanced fusogenicity of HIV-1-NDK in CD4+ lymphocytes as well as for enhanced infectivity of HIV-1-NDK in some CD4- cells lines. The HIV-1-NDK splice donor/packaging sequence and the sequence encoding the gag protein p25 were not important for the variation observed in HIV-1 fusogenicity.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains display a high degree of heterogeneity in their biological properties that correlate with in vivo pathogenesis of the virus. We previously demonstrated that overlapping regions encompassing the third hypervariable domain (V3), within the envelope glycoprotein gp120 determine the tropisms of HIV-1 for T-cell lines and primary macrophages. Studies with mutant viruses carrying one or more amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop have now identified this hypervariable domain as a major determinant for these cellular host range properties. Three to five amino acid changes in this domain, but rarely a single amino acid substitution, can confer macrophage tropism and alter T-cell-line tropism. These findings emphasize the effect on cell tropism of small amino acid differences in the viral envelope and suggest that the overall conformation of the V3 loop plays the major role in determining the ability of HIV-1 to infect T-cell lines and primary macrophages.\",\"NaN\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) displays both interstrain and intrastrain genetic variability. Virus populations with extensive microheterogeneity have been defined as swarms or quasispecies. Many of the genomes within HIV-1 swarms appear to be defective in one or more genes required for viral replication. It is unclear to what extent defective viruses play a role in the process of HIV-1 infection or in the pathogenesis of AIDS. We have isolated two biologically active HIV-1 clones: LW 12.3, which contains defects in the vif and vpr genes, and MN ST.1, which has a defect in the vpu gene. LW 12.3 is unable to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The growth of MN-ST.1 in SupT1 cells is marked by a 3-week lag in extracellular virus production and by the presence of unusually abundant viral buds. We demonstrate here that coinfection of PBMC with these two partially defective HIV-1 clones extends the cellular host range of LW 12.3, significantly increases the replication rate of both viral genomes, and eliminates the delay in production observed with the vpu-defective MN ST.1. When the lesions in vpr and vif of LW 12.3 are repaired, the resultant virus grows normally in PBMC. This is also the case when only vif is repaired, indicating that complementation of LW 12.3 in PBMC by MN ST.1 is mediated by vif in trans. The reciprocal complementation results in a dramatic increase of HIV-1 virulence. This two-component model represents a simplified version of the in vivo situation and illustrates one way in which interaction of defective viruses could increase the spread of infection and progression of disease.\",\"A complementation assay is described that can be used with relative safety to quantitate rapidly inhibitory effects of potential anti-HIV-1 drugs on virtually any stage of the HIV-1 life cycle by measurements of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. Of particular interest is that this system is also capable of detecting inhibition of the viral trans-activator Rev, an important potential target for drug intervention. Other applications of the system may include studies to identify domains of the envelope glycoprotein that determine infectivity and tropism or that define epitopes recognized by neutralization antibodies.\",\"Previously we demonstrated a correlation between a nonsyncytium-inducing (NSI), non-T-cell line tropic phenotype of HIV-1 isolates and the capacity to replicate in primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Here we demonstrate that these NSI, monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates lack the capacity to replicate in two promonocytic cell-lines, HL60 and U937. In contrast, most syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 isolates with tropism for T-cell lines and generally non-monocytotropic were able to establish a productive infection in promonocytic cell lines. Similar differences in tropism for monocytes and promonocytic cell lines were observed with infectious molecular clones. Our results indicate that virological studies on promonocytic cell lines do not necessarily pertain to the HIV-1 infection of monocytes in vivo.\",\"Laboratory isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) such as HTLV-IIIB are generally T cell line-tropic and highly sensitive to neutralization by soluble CD4 (sCD4), a potential antiviral agent that is undergoing clinical trial. However, many primary HIV-1 isolates are macrophage-tropic and sCD4-resistant. Envelope V3 loop sequences derived from primary HIV-1 isolates were sufficient to confer on HTLV-IIIB not only the tissue tropism but also the degree of sCD4 neutralization resistance characteristic of their HIV-1 strains of origin. Single amino acid changes in the V3 loop enhanced sCD4 resistance by up to tenfold. These observations suggest that the tissue tropism and sCD4 neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 isolates are regulated by similar mechanisms.\",\"Virus derived from an infectious molecular clone of the ELI strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replicates well in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in some CD4-positive cell lines but exhibits a delayed time course of infection in CEM and H9 cells and fails to infect SupT1 and U937 cells. If the virus that emerges from infected H9 cells is used to infect CEM and H9 cells, the time course of infection is accelerated and the virus is able to infect U937 and SupT1 cells. In this study, we used the technique of polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism to localize changes in both the extracellular gp120 and the transmembrane gp41 components of the envelope gene associated with adaptation to growth in tissue culture cell lines. Specifically, mutations were identified both in a region of gp120 implicated in CD4 binding and in the amino-terminal portion of gp41 adjacent to the region involved in fusion. No changes were found in the V3 loop of gp120, a region previously shown to be involved in viral tropism. When these mutations were introduced into the original molecular clone, they conferred an enhanced replicative capacity on ELI. These results demonstrate that two additional determinants in the HIV-1 envelope protein influence viral tropism and growth in vitro. They also may have important implications for the generation of viruses with increased growth potential and expanded host range seen in the late stages of HIV disease.\",\"We established persistent infection with a strain of human immunodeficiency type 1, HTLV-IIIB, in a ++promyelo-monocytic cell line, ML-1 (CD4 antigen nearly negative and CD4 mRNA negative), and a promonocytic cell line, THP-1 (CD4 antigen positive). Different reactions of giant cell formation were found after cocultivation of infected and uninfected cells of ML-1, HL-60, THP-1 and U-937 cell lines with uninfected and infected MOLT4 (a T-lymphoma cell line). Factors affecting the cellular tropism of human immunodeficiency virus were discussed.\",\"Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are not constitutively produced by human mononuclear phagocytes. In the present study we have investigated the production of these cytokines in human blood-derived macrophages (BDM) after infection with 16 primary HIV-1 blood isolates obtained from individuals at different stages of disease. In addition, we monitored the replicative capacity of these primary isolates in blood-derived macrophages over a 3-month period. Production of IL-1 alpha was detected in two cultures, IL-beta was positive in two other cultures, and both IL-1 alpha and IL-beta were present in three additional macrophage cultures. IL-1 alpha production was also detected in BDMs infected with the laboratory strain HIV-1 IIIB. In contrast, TNF-alpha was not found in any of the culture supernatants tested. All primary HIV-1 isolates used in these experiments were able to infect BDM productively irrespective of the clinical stage of the patients at the time of virus isolation. The production of IL-1 was mostly found in chronically infected cultures displaying low levels of HIV-1 replication. These results indicate that macrophages tropism is a general feature of all HIV-1 isolates. Furthermore, release of IL-1 by mononuclear phagocytes upon HIV-1 infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 related diseases.\",\"In vitro exposure of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages to T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates fails to establish a productive viral infection. Several studies have shown that such preferential HIV-1 replication in T cells or in mononuclear phagocytes (HIV tropism) may be determined by distinct viral characteristics. In the present study it was demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a factor known to be produced by platelets, macrophages, and other cells present at a wound site, can act as a mediator in overcoming the lymphocytotropic restriction of several well-characterized viral isolates of HIV-1 (i.e., LAV, Z84, pLAI, NY5). Macrophages infected with these isolates show cytopathic changes comparable to those seen upon infection with the monocytotropic isolate ADA. To achieve this effect with TGF-beta, the factor must be present after the infection period. The emerging virus retains its original cellular tropism. Based on these observations the authors propose a role for TGF-beta in the establishment and progression of HIV infection and disease.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the agent of AIDS, frequently infects the central nervous system. We inoculated adult human brain cultures with chimeric viruses containing parts of the env gene of a cloned primary isolate from brain tissue, HIV-1 JRFl, inserted into the cloned DNA of a T-cell-tropic strain. A chimeric virus containing the carboxy-terminal portion of HIV-1 JRFl env did not replicate in these brain tissue cultures, while a chimera expressing an env-encoded protein containing 158 amino acids of HIV-1 JRFl gp120, including the V3 loop, replicated well in brain microglial cells, as it does in blood macrophages. Infection of brain microglial cells with such a chimera was blocked by an antibody to the V3 loop of gp 120. Thus, env determinants in the region of gp120, outside the CD4-binding site and comprising the V3 loop, are critical for efficient viral binding to and/or entry into human brain microglia.\",\"Strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 differ in their abilities to infect and replicate in primary human macrophages. Chimeric clones were constructed from a provirus unable to infect macrophages (NLHX) and envelope sequences (V3 loop) of viruses derived without cultivation from brain (YU2 and w1-1c1) or spleen (w2-1b4) tissues. The substituted V3 loop sequences in each case were sufficient to confer upon NLHX the ability to infect macrophages. Furthermore, an envelope domain immediately N terminal to the V3 loop also was found to modulate the level of replication in macrophages. These results demonstrate that an envelope determinant derived directly from patients with AIDS confers HIV-1 tropism for macrophages.\",\"A series of chimeric clones between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) were constructed. Viability of the recombinant viruses was dependent on the position of recombination. Infectious chimeric viruses between HIV-1 and SIVAGM (isolated from an African green monkey) and those between HIV-1 and SIVMAC (isolated from a rhesus monkey) were examined for host cell tropism. Viral determinants that restrict the replication of SIVAGM in human MT-4 cells and that of HIV-1 in macaque monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) mapped to the 5' half of the virus genome. One HIV-1/SIVMAC chimera which contained the HIV-1 env gene was shown to replicate in macaque PBMC in vitro and to infect macaque monkeys in vivo. This HIV-1/SIVMAC chimera will be useful for a variety of AIDS pathogenesis and vaccine studies.\",\"The infectivity of different strains of HIV-1 in rabbits was investigated. The HIV-1RF and HIV-1MN inocula induced anti-envelope antibodies detectable by Western blot, and in the case of HIV-1RF, these antibodies were also detectable by ELISA. The peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and lymph nodes from rabbits inoculated with HIV-1IIIB, HIV-1MN and HIV-1Z3, were positive for virus by culture and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HIV-1BRVA, originally isolated from a patient with AIDS dementia, infected the brain of the inoculated rabbit, as indicated by both virus culture and PCR. In this case PCR was positive using four different primer pairs. Throughout the study, rabbits showed no clinical signs of HIV-1 infection and no remarkable histopathology was observed in the tissues examined. The apparent differences in infectivity and tissue tropism of the five HIV-1 strains demonstrated here provide additional evidence that the rabbit may serve as a useful model for studying HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis.\",\"Different isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vary in the cell tropisms they display, i.e., the range of cell types in which they are able to establish a productive infection. Here, we report on the phenotypes of recombinants between two molecularly cloned strains of HIV-1. Our results prove that the envelope glycoprotein gp120 is solely responsible for the difference in cell tropism between the two parental isolates and that no other genes or sequences are involved in determining the cell tropism of these strains. The region of the envelope involved in the determination of cell tropism includes sequences which encode the V3 loop of gp120. Control of cell tropism by this region of the virus env gene is a general phenomenon which applies to many different HIV-1 isolates.\",\"We have previously demonstrated that detection of syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 in asymptomatic seropositive individuals is associated with rapid progression to AIDS. In the present study, we sought to develop and evaluate an HIV-1 phenotyping assay for the screening of large numbers of individuals. Efficiency of HIV-1 isolation from patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was studied with donor PBMC or seven different CD4+ T-cell lines as target cells. The biological phenotype of sequential isolates from 20 long-term asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive individuals was determined by two different assays. Non-SI isolates, efficiently recovered by cocultivation with donor PBMC, were never isolated with T-cell lines as target cells. Direct cocultivation with MT-2 cells, but not with six other CD4+ T-cells, resulted in the efficient recovery of SI isolates. HIV-1 MT-2 tropism and SI capacity were shown to be coupled properties at the clonal level. SI isolates emerged in 10 out of 20 longitudinally-studied individuals. In these long-term infected individuals, appearance of SI isolates was associated with progression to AIDS. Direct cocultivation of patient PBMC with the MT-2 cell line is a sensitive, specific and convenient method to detect SI isolates. The availability of an assay suitable for the screening of large groups allows further study of the value of HIV-1 biological phenotyping as a prognostic marker.\",\"Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) isolated from infected individuals show genetic and biological diversity. To delineate the genetic determinants underlying specific biological characteristics such as rate of replication and cellular tropism, generation of hybrid HIV using viruses which exhibit distinct biological feature is essential. We have used three different infectious HIV proviral DNAs, designated pZ6, pHXB2 and pARV, derived from HIVZr6, HIVHTLV-IIIB and HIVSF-2 strains, respectively, to construct hybrid HIV. Proviral DNAs differed in their ability to direct the synthesis of viral particles upon transfection into cells and the viruses derived from the molecular clones exhibited different cellular tropism. Three different methods were utilized to generate hybrid HIV, including construction of hybrid proviral DNA using molecular techniques, intracellular ligation of viral DNA fragments and the homologous recombination approach. The chimeric proviral DNAs with exchanges involving only the long terminal repeat (LTR) region indicated that LTR does not exert influence on the overall level of virus production despite extensive differences in the U3 region of the LTR. Regarding the cellular tropism of HIV, the virus derived from pHXB2 productively infected CEMx174 cells. On the other hand, pARV-derived virus did not show productive infection of CEMx174 cells. The hybrid HIV containing the 3'-end of the genome from pARV and the 5'-end of the genome from pHXB2 was effective in infecting CEMx174 cells. However, the converse hybrid containing the 5'-pARV and the 3'-pHXB2 was not effective in infecting CEMx174 cells. These results suggest that differences in the genes outside of env and nef may play a role in the ability of virus to infect a certain cell type.\",\"Cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage are the predominant cell type producing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in extravascular tissues; HIV-1 infection of mononuclear phagocytes may be directly related to primary disease manifestations and also appears to contribute to the immune deficiency of AIDS. Whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes are permissive for nearly all strains of HIV-1, only some HIV-1 strains replicate efficiently in mononuclear phagocytes. Recombinant virus strains have been used to identify a 157-amino acid region of gp120 that can confer macrophage tropism. This region is distinct from the principal CD4 binding domain of gp120 and includes the major type-specific neutralizing epitope located in the third hypervariable domain, V3. Quantitative assay of HIV-1-specific DNA by polymerase chain reaction early after infection suggests that HIV-1 strain differences in macrophage tropism are determined at the level of entry. These studies suggest that target cell interactions with gp120 in addition to or in conjunction with the CD4 binding domain are necessary for efficient entry into mononuclear phagocytes.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in addition to lymphocytes, and infection of these cells may be responsible for viral persistence and dissemination, encephalopathy of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other sequelae of HIV infection. We have developed an in vitro model utilizing peripheral-blood monocyte-derived macrophages to study HIV-1 infection of macrophages. HIV-1 isolates vary greatly in their ability to infect and replicate in macrophages, from highly restricted to highly productive infection. Productively infected macrophages undergo syncytium formation but remain viable in culture and support sustained levels of virus production for prolonged periods. Transformed monocytoid and lymphoid cell lines, however, show very different patterns of permissiveness for HIV-1 strains and do not reflect their corresponding primary cell types in studies of host cell tropism. Studies on viral entry show that the CD4 molecule, known to be the HIV receptor on lymphoid cells, is expressed at low levels on the surface of macrophages as well, where it functions as the receptor for viral entry. Therefore, differential host cell tropism does not result from the use of an alternative macrophage-specific receptor instead of CD4.\",\"Fifty-seven HIV-1 strains were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 102 HIV-infected persons involved in epidemic outbreaks in different cities of the USSR. The effectiveness of isolation was 29.1% in asymptomatic infection, 51.7% in cases with generalized lymphadenopathy, and 82.6% in persons with severe clinical manifestations. Identification of the isolates by indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA, reverse transcriptase activity, Western blot, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction showed them to belong to HIV-1 type. Reproduction of the isolates in cell cultures was accompanied by cytopathic effect and syncytium formation. The isolated strains can be divided into two groups: (1) the poorly growing isolates with low or negative RT and ELISA results and (2) the isolates with high infectivity, broad spectrum of cell tropism, and high levels of RT and ELISA. These data show the correlation of biological properties of HIV-1 strains isolated in the USSR with those of HIV strains previously isolated in Europe, USA, and Africa.\",\"In humans, macrophages serve as a major reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in the infected host and may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In HIV-1-infected chimpanzees, however, virus could not be recovered from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, leaving the question of macrophage tropism of HIV-1 in this species unresolved. The data reported that HIV-1 IIIB shows dual tropism and is infectious for both chimpanzee monocytes and lymphocytes in vitro. Viral replication in chimpanzee monocytes was clearly demonstrated by infection of allogeneic phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts in vitro and by electron microscopy (EM). EM revealed HIV particles associated with 10-15% of the HIV-1 IIIB-infected chimpanzee monocytes. Viral particles budding from the monocyte surface in the typical crescent form were noted as well. This is in contrast to the human situation, where monocytotropic HIV strains preferentially bud into and accumulate in cytoplasmic vacuoles. These results indicate that both lymphocytes and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage replicate virus in the chimpanzee; the cell tropism of viral strains, however, is different in chimpanzees and humans.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) gene expression is downmodulated by sequence elements downstream of the transcriptional initiation site, corresponding to the U5 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) and further downstream. This repression appeared to be related more to the length of the sequence intervening the transcriptional initiation site and the coding region than to a particular sequence content. The repressive effect of the downstream segment was not affected by HIV-2 and HIV-1 TAT or by the cytomegalovirus transactivator IE-2 gene. Nor was it affected by T-cell activation signals or by such cytokines as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and interferon-alpha (IFN alpha). In contrast to HIV-1, HIV-2 LTR-directed gene expression was not modulated by TNF-alpha. A specific sequence element, located downstream of the TAR element in the R region, seemed to participate in modulation of gene expression. This element interacted with a nuclear protein with a mobility of about 26 kD. The repressive effect of the downstream sequence was to a certain extent cell type dependent, suggesting the involvement of cell type-specific factors. It was more effective in human lymphocytic CEM cells than in Jurkat cells. This may be relevant to the HIV-2 cell tropism (replication), latency, and virulence.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from 25 perinatally HIV-1 infected children were classified according to their capacity to replicate in vitro as rapid (R), intermediate (S/R) and slow (S) variants. R-type viruses replicated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and grew better in T-lymphoid cells, even though 9 out of 12 isolates also maintained tropism for monocytoid cells. The S/R-type isolates replicated efficiently after several days of culture, while the S-type viruses displayed only a low and transient replication activity; however, both S/R- and S-type isolates exerted viral transactivation activity in an indicator monocytoid cell line. Replication patterns in vitro were significantly associated in vivo with the number of HIV-1 copies in PBMCs as determined by polymerase chain reaction: in children with R-type isolates, the number of HIV-1 proviral DNA molecules/10(5) PBMCs ranged from 62 to 571, and in children with S/R and S isolates the range was 5-43. Seven children had severe symptomatic HIV-1 infection, and in all an R-type virus was identified; 18 children had no or only mild symptoms, and among these, S-, S/R-, and R-type isolates were found in 5, 8, and 5 cases, respectively. Besides demonstrating HIV-1 variability in perinatal infection, these findings suggest that R-type virus might be a prerequisite for disease progression.\",\"The construction and preliminary biological characterization of three molecular clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are reported: HIV-1LAI from a French man with AIDS, HIV-1MAL from a Zairian boy with ARC, and HIV-1ELI from a Zairian woman with AIDS. All three sequences were found to code for infectious viruses. Both the host range and the kinetics of infection in CD4+ cells were different for the three viruses. Virus derived from each molecular clone was infectious on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), although LAI and ELI displayed more rapid growth kinetics than MAL. The viruses had different tropisms and growth kinetics in six cell lines. LAI was infectious in all of the cell lines and produced high levels of reverse transcriptase activity. MAL and ELI had more restricted tropisms: MAL could only replicate on SupT1, whereas ELI grew on Jurkat and MT-4, was delayed on CEM and H9, and was unable to infect U937 cells. In addition, we observed that both the replicative capacity and the cell tropism of viruses could change after passage through some established cell lines. These results suggest that the genotypes of some viruses in vitro are not stable and that selection for growth can cause the fairly rapid appearance of variants with increased growth potential.\",\"Fifteen human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) isolates from normal donors and patients with AIDS, systemic lupus erythematosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, collagen-vascular disease, leukopenia, bone marrow transplants, Exanthem subitum (roseola), and atypical polyclonal lymphoproliferation were studied for their tropism to fresh human cord blood mononuclear cells, growth in continuous T cell lines, reactivity to monoclonal antibodies, and by restriction enzyme banding patterns. All isolates replicated efficiently in human cord blood mononuclear cells, but mitogen stimulation of the cells prior to infection was required. The ability to infect continuous T-cell lines varied with the isolates. Isolates similar to GS prototype infected HSB2 and Sup T1 cells and did not infect Molt-3 cells, whereas isolates similar to Z-29 infected Molt-3 cells but not HSB2 and Sup T1 cells. Some of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the HHV-6 (GS) isolate showed reactivity with all isolates tested, but others only reacted with HHV-6 isolates similar to the GS isolate and not with those similar to Z-29 isolate. Restriction enzyme analysis using EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII revealed that HHV-6 isolates from roseola, bone marrow transplant, leukopenia, and an HIV-1-positive AIDS patient from Zaire (Z-29) were closely related but distinct from GS type HHV-6 isolates. Based on the above findings, we propose that, like herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, the 15 HHV-6 isolates analyzed can be divided into group A (GS type) and group B (Z-29 type).\",\"Infectious molecular clones of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been very important tools for the analysis of regulatory gene functions and the study of differential cell tropism. We have cloned and characterized a proviral sequence of HIVmn from mn strain infected H9 cells. This clone, called KP1, was found to be infectious for different cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). KP1 proviral DNA was detected in HUT-78 cells and human PBL by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis after infection of these cells with cell-free supernatants from KP1 transfected human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an infectious molecular clone of HIVmn which is a representative of one of the most prevalent strains of HIV-1 in North America and Europe. Biologically active clones of a broadly antigenic strain such as HIVmn will be extremely useful in therapeutic approaches for AIDS.\",\"Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) isolated from infected individuals show tremendous genetic and biologic diversity. To delineate the genetic determinants underlying specific biologic characteristics, such as rate of replication, cytopathic effects, and ability to infect macrophages and T4 lymphoid cells, generation of hybrid HIV using viruses which exhibit distinct biologic features is essential. To develop methods for generating hybrid HIV, we constructed truncated HIV proviral DNA plasmids. Upon digestion with restriction enzymes, these plasmid DNAs were cotransfected into human rhabdomyosarcoma cells to generate hybrid HIV. The hybrid HIVs derived by this method were infectious upon transmission to both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes and established human leukemic T-cell lines. The virus derived from molecular clone pHXB2 (HIVHTLV-III) productively infected CEMx174 cells. On the other hand, molecular clone pARV (HIVSF2)-derived virus did not show productive infection of CEMx174 cells when used as a cell-free virus. The hybrid HIV containing the 3' end of the genome from pARV and the 5' end of the genome from pHXB2 was effective in infecting CEMx174 cells, but the converse hybrid containing 5' pARV and 3' pHXB2 was not effective in infecting CEMx174 cells. These results suggest that differences in the genes outside of env and nef play a role in the ability of the virus to infect a certain cell type. The intracellular ligation method should be useful in the analysis of related and unrelated HIV-1 isolates with common restriction enzyme cleavage sites.\",\"Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are targets for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in vivo. However, many laboratory strains of HIV-1 that efficiently infect transformed T cell lines replicate poorly in macrophages. A 20-amino acid sequence from the macrophage-tropic BaL isolate of HIV-1 was sufficient to confer macrophage tropism on HTLV-IIIB, a T cell line--tropic isolate. This small sequence element is in the V3 loop, the envelope domain that is the principal neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. Thus, the V3 loop not only serves as a target of the host immune response but is also pivotal in determining HIV-1 tissue tropism.\",\"We constructed five chimeric clones between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVMAC) and four SIVMAC mutants by recombinant DNA techniques. Three chimeric clones and all mutants with an alteration in either the vif, vpx, vpr, or nef gene were infectious to human CD4-positive cell lines. The susceptibility of macaque monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to infection by these mutants and chimeras was examined in vitro. Macaque PBMC supported the replication of wild-type and vpx, vpr, and nef mutant SIVMAC strains. A chimera carrying the long terminal repeats (LTRs), gag, pol, vif, and vpx of SIVMAC and tat, rev, vpu, and env of HIV-1 was also replication competent in PBMC. In contrast, HIV-1, the vif mutant of SIVMAC, a chimera containing rev and env of SIVMAC, and a chimera containing vpx, vpr, tat, rev, and env of SIVMAC did not grow in PBMC. Western immunoblotting analysis of the replicating chimera in PBMC confirmed the hybrid nature of the virus. These data strongly suggested that the sequence important for macaque cell tropism lies within the LTR, gag, pol, and/or vif sequences of the SIVMAC genome.\",\"Alterations in two highly conserved N-linked glycosylation sites within the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) implicated in the phenotype of a noncytopathic HIV-1 variant were introduced independently and in combination into a cytopathic, infectious HIV-1 clone by site-specific mutagenesis. Neither mutation affected the synthesis of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. However, one of the mutations restricted the ability of HIV-1 envelope to localize on the cell membrane and thus markedly impaired virus assembly. The HIV-1 assembly defect could be overcome in trans if site-specific mutants were packaged in HeLa cells constitutively producing wild-type HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. In addition to inefficient virus assembly, this mutation impaired the ability of the virus to infect CD4+ T cells, but did not affect CD4-independent infection of muscle cells. These results suggest additional functions of posttranslational modification in virus replication (i.e., envelope glycoprotein transport). Given that such modifications can restrict CD4-mediated uptake without affecting CD4-independent uptake, variations in posttranslational env processing between different HIV-1 genotypes may affect virus tropism in vivo.\",\"Previously, we and others have demonstrated a relation between the clinical course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and biological properties of HIV-1 variants such as replication rate, syncytium-inducing (SI) capacity, and cytotropism. For the molecular analysis of the biological variability in these properties, we generated a panel of phenotypically distinct yet genetically highly homologous infectious molecular clones. These clones were derived from HIV-1 isolates, mostly recovered by direct clonal isolation, from a single individual in whom a transition from non-SI to SI isolates had been identified over time. Of 17 molecular clones tested, 8 were infectious. The clones exhibited differences in SI capacity and T-cell line tropism. Their phenotypes corresponded to those of their parental isolates, formally demonstrating that biological variability of HIV-1 isolates can be attributed to single molecular clones. With these clones we demonstrated that SI capacity and tropism for the H9 T-cell line, almost invariably coupled in primary HIV-1 isolates, are discernible properties. Also different requirements appeared to exist for H9 and Sup T1 cell line tropism. We obtained evidence that T-cell line tropism is not caused by differences in level of HIV-1 expression but most probably is restricted at the level of virus entry. Restriction mapping of four clones with divergent phenotypes revealed a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology (over 96.3%), indicating the usefulness of these clones for the tracking of genetic variability critical for differences in biological phenotype.\",\"We have isolated a variant of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) which is highly infectious to fibroblastlike cells (BT cells) derived from human brain as well as CD4-positive T cells. This variant HIV-1, named HIV[GUN-1V], was obtained by infecting BT cells with a prototype HIV-1 isolate, named HIV[GUN-1WT], which is highly infectious to T cells but barely infectious to BT cells. HIV[GUN-1V] infects BT cells productively and this infection appeared to be mediated by CD4. To elucidate the viral gene responsible for the host range difference between the variant and prototype HIV-1s, we cloned and analyzed the provirus genomes of the two viruses. Examination of the infectivities of BT cells by various recombinant viruses and analyses of the nucleotide sequences of HIV[GUN-1V] and HIV[GUN-1WT] showed that a single nucleotide exchange was responsible for their difference in infectivity of BT cells: HIV[GUN-1V] contains a thymine residue instead of the cytosine residue in HIV[GUN-1WT] at position 931 of the env coding sequence. Replacement of cytosine by thymine at this position of the env coding sequence of the HIV[GUN-1WT] genome induced the ability to infect BT cells. The base exchange at this position was expected to change amino acid 311 of the envelope glycoprotein, gp120, from proline to serine, which is located in a variable region containing type-specific immunodominant epitopes. Thus, HIV[GUN-1V] acquired a wider host range than HIV[GUN-1WT] by a single point mutation in the env gene.\",\"HIV-1 strains, including a molecularly cloned isolate, that had been passaged through different cell types adapted to faster growth in the same cell type and displayed a different host cell tropism. The only change in viral proteins revealed by immunoblot analyses was the molecular size of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 that varied for viruses recovered from the different infected cells. The alteration in size was most likely the result of modification of gp120. Host range differences were also observed for a molecularly cloned HIV-1 strain when passed through the peripheral white blood cells from different individuals. Thus, this phenomenon could have clinical relevance in HIV pathogenesis.\",\"We reported some biological properties of HIV-1 isolated from 16 hemophiliac Japanese and accidentally infected one mother. Peripheral mononuclear cells (PMCs) were obtained from them, one with AIDS, one with lymphadenopathy and the others were asymptomatic carriers. CD 8 depleted PMCs were obtained by panning methods. They were cocultivated with PHA-stimulated PMCs from seronegative donors. Fifteen HIV-1 isolates were obtained from 17 cases. Recovery rate was 87.5%. The replication rate of HIV-1 from AIDS patient was faster than other isolates from asymptomatic carriers. They did not from plaques on MT 4 cells. The host range study showed that all fifteen isolates infected primary macrophages and only two simultaneously infected human T cell line (MT 2). None of them showed infectivity to other T cell, B cell or monocytic cell lines. Although our study population was rather small, these results suggested that the majority of seropositive hemophiliac Japanese were already infected by HIV-1 and had the risk for the development of AIDS. Moreover, we recognized that HIV-1 from hemophiliac Japanese showed characteristic biological features, i,e, such as 1) weak cytopathic effects, 2) narrow host range and 3) tropism to primary macrophages. It is suggested that they may belong to a unique subtype of HIV-1 and their selective infectivity to primary macrophages have some relation to the clinical status of seropositive hemophiliacs. Further study is necessary to clarify these points.\",\"The long terminal repeats (LTRs) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains from the central nervous systems of four patients with AIDS and of an HIV-1 isolate which is highly macrophage-tropic were isolated by using the polymerase chain reaction. In transient transfection assays, these LTRs demonstrated no significant difference in basal or stimulated levels of transcription in any of a variety of cell lines tested, compared with expression directed from the LTR of a T-lymphocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1. Chimeric viruses were created with the LTRs of the macrophage-tropic and brain-derived viruses ligated to the viral backbone from a T-lymphocyte-tropic strain. No change in cellular tropism was demonstrated with these chimeric viruses. Thus, unlike the LTRs of some murine retroviruses, the LTR of HIV-1 does not appear to play a major role in determining cellular tropism.\",\"The envelope glycoprotein gp120 of primate immunodeficiency viruses initiates viral attachment to CD4+ cells by binding to the CD4 antigen on host cell surfaces. However, among different CD4+ cell types, different viruses display distinct host cell ranges and cytopathicities. Determinants for both of these biological properties have been mapped to the env gene. We have quantitatively compared the CD4 binding affinities of gp120 proteins from viruses exhibiting different host cell tropisms and cytopathicities. The viral proteins were produced by using a Drosophila cell expression system and were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity. Drosophila-produced gp120 from T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) BH10 exhibits binding to soluble recombinant CD4 (sCD4) and syncytia inhibition potency identical to that of pure authentic viral gp120. Relative to the affinity of HIV-1 BH10 gp120 for sCD4, that of dual tropic HIV-1 Ba-L is 6-fold lower, that of restricted T-cell tropic simian immunodeficiency virus mac is 70-fold lower, and that of noncytopathic HIV-2 ST is greater than 280-fold lower. Thus, viruses that utilize CD4 for infection do so by using a remarkably wide range of envelope affinities. These differences in affinity may play a role in determining cell tropism and cytopathicity.\",\"Strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) display a high degree of biological heterogeneity which may be linked to certain clinical manifestation of AIDS. They vary in their ability to infect different cell types, to replicate rapidly and to high titre in culture, to down-modulate the CD4 receptor, and to cause cytopathic changes in infected cells. Some of these in vitro properties correlate with pathogenicity of the virus in vivo. To map the viral determinants of the cellular host range of HIV-1, recombinant viruses were generated between biologically active molecular clones of HIV-1 isolates showing differences in infection of primary peripheral blood macrophages and established T-cell lines. We report here that a specific region of the envelope gp120 gene representing 159 amino-acid residues of glycoprotein gp120 seems to determine macrophage tropism, whereas an overlapping region representing 321 amino-acid residues determines T cell-line tropism. These studies provide a basis for relating functional domains of the HIV-1 env gene to pathogenic potential.\",\"We previously demonstrated a correlation between the presence of syncytium-inducing (SI) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants showing tropism for cell line H9 and the occurrence of rapid CD4 cell decline and progression to AIDS. In contrast, in stable asymptomatic individuals, we detected only isolates with low replication rates that were non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) and nontropic for the H9 cell line. Here, we investigated the monocytotropism of established HIV-1 isolates with a panel of isolates and with biological HIV-1 clones with distinct phenotypes. Moreover, the prevalence and biological phenotypes of monocytotropic HIV-1 variants in the course of HIV-1 infection were analyzed in comparative primary isolation studies on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). In cell-free infection studies with MDM from eight blood donors, 13 of 17 NSI isolates but only 4 of 14 SI isolates were able to infect MDM. NSI isolates also infected significantly more different donors than SI variants (median, 3 of 8 versus 0 of 8). This enhanced monocytotropism of NSI isolates was confirmed in experiments with biological HIV-1 clones with distinct phenotypes recovered from the same donor. To investigate the prevalence and biological phenotypes of monocytotropic variants in different stages of HIV-1 infection, sequential isolates from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from nine asymptomatic individuals, five of whom progressed to AIDS and seven of whom had a known time of seroconversion, were recovered by cocultivation with both PBL and MDM. Monocytotropic variants were obtained from 37 of 42 time points. All monocytotropic variants were NSI in PBL culture and non-T-cell-line tropic, even when SI, T-cell-line-tropic HIV-1 variants could be recovered from the same patient sample by cocultivation with PBL. We conclude that monocytotropic HIV-1 variants mostly have an NSI phenotype in PBL and, in contrast to SI variants, are present at all stages of HIV-1 infection. These results suggest an important role for monocytotropic variants in the persistence of HIV-1 infection.\",\"The human CD4 glycoprotein is a specific receptor for the HIV family of retroviruses. When expressed on human cell lines, this molecule binds virus through direct interactions with the gp 120 viral envelope glycoprotein thus allowing virus infection to occur. Subsequent to binding, conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoproteins are thought to facilitate virus entry into the target cell through direct fusion of the virus with the cell membrane. In contrast to the infection observed in human cell lines, infection of murine cell lines even in the presence of the CD4 receptor does not readily occur. We have examined this species tropism of HIV infection. We report that the inability to infect murine cells is not a function of the receptor for HIV or a suppressive function of the murine cellular background. Human CD4 expression, configuration and down-modulation on the murine background are similar if not identical to expression on the human cell background. Utilizing a panel of interspecific cell hybridomas, we have been able to bypass the barrier to infectivity of human CD4-positive murine cells. We demonstrate that there are at least two different restrictions to infectivity on the mouse background which can be complemented by the human genome. One restriction appears to be an extremely early postbinding function likely to be molecules necessary for viral entry into cells, the second restriction is necessary for high levels of virus production. Our mapping studies suggest that fewer than five human chromosomes are necessary for reconstituting infectivity in the murine background. These results have implications for models of HIV-induced pathogenesis and infectivity.\",\"Several epidemiologic and clinical studies suggest that patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the primary etiologic agent in AIDS, and other viruses, such as cytomegalovirus or human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), have a more severe clinical course than those infected with HIV alone. Cells infected with two viruses can, in some cases, give rise to phenotypically mixed virions with altered or broadened cell tropism and could therefore account for some of these findings. Such pseudotypes could alter the course of disease by infecting more tissues than are normally infected by HIV. We show here that HIV type 1 (HIV-1) efficiently incorporates the HTLV type I (HTLV-I) envelope glycoprotein and that both HIV-1 and HTLV-II accept other widely divergent envelope glycoproteins to form infectious pseudotype viruses whose cellular tropisms and relative abilities to be transmitted by cell-free virions or by cell contact are determined by the heterologous envelope. We also show that the mechanism by which virions incorporate heterologous envelope glycoproteins is independent of the presence of the homologous glycoprotein or heterologous gag proteins. These results may have important implications for the mechanism of HIV pathogenesis.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) have a similar tropism for target cell types, especially for CD4+ T cells. In this study, we provide evidence that receptors of these two viruses exist independently on the target cell. We established an HTLV-I-producing CD8+ T cell line (ILT-8M2) with a remarkable cell fusion capacity. When cocultured with MOLT-4 cells, ILT-8M2 cells induced giant syncytia more efficiently than any other tested HTLV-I-producer cell lines. In contrast to other HTLV-I-producers, ILT-8M2 cells were minimally susceptible to cytopathic effects of HIV-1 due to very low expression of CD4, although they were able to be persistently infected by HIV-1. The indicator MOLT-4 cells are known to respond well to HIV-1-induced cell fusion, but they lose this ability if they become persistently infected with HIV-1 because of the reduction of CD4 receptor expression. ILT-8M2 was, however, still capable of inducing syncytia with the MOLT-4 cells persistently infected by HIV-1 (MOLT-4/IIIB). This syncytium formation was dependent on the HTLV-I-envelope, as it was inhibited by HTLV-I-positive human sera or a monoclonal antibody to HTLV-I gp46 but not by monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 gp120 or CD4. Moreover, ILT-8M2 cells persistently infected by HIV-1 (ILT-8M2/IIIB) induced both HTLV-I- and HIV-1-mediated syncytia with uninfected MOLT-4 cells. These results suggest that HTLV-I induces cell fusion utilizing receptors on the target cells independent of HIV-1-receptors.\",\"Although the mechanism responsible for HIV-1 entry into susceptible CD4+ T cells is incompletely understood, a number of key components are now known. For example, the tropism of HIV-1 for cells expressing the CD4 membrane glycoprotein reflects the use of this protein as a specific viral receptor to which the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein binds with high affinity. This binding apparently results in the exposure of hydrophobic domains of the gp41 transmembrane protein to apposing plasma membrane components, resulting in the fusion of viral and plasma membranes to one another which, in turn, releases HIV-1 RNA into the cytosol. This fusion event, which is requisite for viral entry as well as HIV-1 associated syncytia formation, occurs in a pH-independent fashion, but requires antecedent T cell activation. In the absence of T cell stimuli, resting CD4+ cells are resistant to HIV-1 entry, which may explain the observation that at any given time the vast majority of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 seropositive patients are not infected despite the presence of relatively large quantities of free virus in the blood of such patients. The mechanism of HIV-1 entry into other CD4+ cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, remains to be determined.\",\"NaN\",\"To examine the restriction of HIV growth in murine cells, we infected NIH 3T3 cells with HIV pseudotyped by Moloney murine leukemia virus. The virus, which carried a dominant selectable marker under the control of the HIV LTR, gave large numbers of resistant clones, showing that murine cells are permissive for HIV uncoating, reverse transcription, nuclear transport and integration. However, we found that several murine cell lines, as well as CHO cells, could not support the function of rev, the viral regulatory gene which, in human cells, induces the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced class of HIV mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins. Transfection of the HIV-infected murine cells with a HTLV-1 rex-expressing vector failed to rescue the rev- phenotype, indicating that the block extended to rex function. Most importantly, we could complement the rev defect by fusing the infected murine with uninfected human cells. We conclude that HIV tropism is partly a consequence of a trans-acting cellular factor critical for Rev function.\",\"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related disorders, it has been suggested that viral cofactors may accelerate the progression of the disease. We present evidence that human T lymphoid cells productively coinfected by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) or HTLV-II generate a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles that allow the penetration of HIV-1 into previously nonsusceptible CD4- human cells, including mature CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphoid cells, epithelial cells, and skeletal muscle cells. The infection is independent of the major HIV-1 receptor, (i.e., the CD4 glycoprotein) since OKT4a, a neutralizing anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, fails to block the penetration of HIV-1. Similarly, infection is not inhibited by monoclonal antibody M77, directed toward the neutralizing loop of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1. In contrast, pretreatment of the virus stock with HTLV-I-neutralizing human serum completely abolishes the penetration of phenotypically mixed HIV-1 into CD4- cells. These results suggest that HTLV-I or HTLV-II may increase the pathogenicity of HIV-1 by broadening the spectrum of its cellular tropism and, thus, favoring its spread within the organism of coinfected hosts.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) may represent a subgroup that displays a host cell tropism different from those isolated from peripheral blood and lymph nodes. One CNS-derived isolate, HIV-1SF128A, which can be propagated efficiently in primary macrophage culture but not in any T-cell lines, was molecularly cloned and characterized. Recombinant viruses between HIV-1SF128A and the peripheral blood isolate HIV-1SF2 were generated in order to map the viral gene(s) responsible for the macrophage tropism. The env gene sequences of the two isolates are about 91.1% homologous, with variations scattered mainly in the hypervariable regions of gp120. Recombinant viruses that have acquired the HIV-1SF128A env gene display HIV-1SF128A tropism for macrophages. Furthermore, the gp120 variable domains, V1, V2, V4, and V5, the CD4-binding domain, and the gp41 fusion domain are not directly involved in determining macrophage tropism.\",\"Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are the predominant cell producing HIV-1 in most tissues including the central nervous system (CNS), spinal cord, lung and skin; infection is associated with dementia, neuropathy, pneumonitis, and dermatitis respectively. Different HIV-1 isolates vary markedly in their ability to infect mononuclear phagocytes productively. Here we describe molecular clones of a CNS-derived isolate, HIV-1(JR-FL), which can replicate efficiently in mononuclear phagocytes. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of early events after infection indicates that the early phase of viral replication before reverse transcription determines tropism. Genetic mapping of the macrophage-tropic phenotype by construction of recombinant viruses indicates that mononuclear phagocyte infectivity can be determined by a 157-amino-acid region of the gp 120 glycoprotein of HIV-1(JR-FL). Significantly, this region is upstream from the previously defined CD4-binding domain. We propose that at least one determinant for mononuclear phagocyte tropism involves target cell interactions with regions of gp120 distinct from the CD4-binding domain.\",\"Different strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vary in the ability to replicate in cells that bear the HIV-1 receptor, CD4. The mechanism responsible for these cell tropism differences is unknown. We examined different isolates of HIV-1 with regard to replication in specific tumor-derived CD4-positive T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. To investigate early events in the virus life cycle at low multiplicities of infection, we used a modification of the polymerase chain reaction method. Use of a molecularly cloned primary HIV-1 isolate, HIV-1 JR-CSF, restricted for replication in T-cell lines, demonstrated that little or no viral DNA or RNA was synthesized in nonpermissive cells after infection. However, transfection of proviral DNA resulted in efficient transient virus production from these cells. Therefore, we conclude that at least one block to infection for HIV-1 strains in nonpermissive T cells occurs at a point in entry or uncoating before provirus formation.\",\"The growth properties and cytopathic effects of several HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were compared between cultures on human lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, respectively. For some isolates (among these three paired isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid) replication and cytopathogenicity were comparable between lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages (dual tropic viruses), while others showed a very specific tropism for only one cell type. Yet another subtype grew neither well on lymphocytes nor on macrophages. Taking into account the growth properties in monocytes/macrophages we propose a classification system for HIV subtypes on these cells (alpha-delta), in analogy to the nomenclature for HIV-subtyping on lymphocytes (a-d). Using this system, some prototypic viruses (LAV/HTLV-IIIB, HIV-2ROD, SIVBK28, HIV-2ALT) as well as several other HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates were subtyped.\",\"The genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is highly heterogeneous. Some of this genomic variability is reflected in the biologic and serologic differences observed among various strains of HIV-1. To map the viral determinants that correlate with pathogenicity of the virus, recombinant viruses were generated between biologically active molecular clones of HIV-1 strains that show differences in T-cell or macrophage tropism, cytopathogenicity, CD4 antigen modulation, and susceptibility to serum neutralization. The results of these studies indicate that the envelope region contains the major determinants of these viral features. Further studies with sequence exchanges within this region should help identify specific domains that contribute to HIV pathogenesis.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently causes neurological dysfunction and is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with HIV encephalitis or myelopathy. The virus is found mostly in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage within the CNS, but the possibility of infection of other glial cells has been raised. Therefore, the effects of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were studied in primary cultures of adult human brain containing microglial cells, the resident CNS macrophages, and astrocytes. These cultures could be productively infected with macrophage-adapted HIV-1 isolates but not with T lymphocyte-adapted HIV-1 isolates or two HIV-2 isolates. As determined with a triple-label procedure, primary astrocytes did not express HIV gag antigens and remained normal throughout the 3-week course of infection. In contrast, virus replicated in neighboring microglial cells, often leading to their cell fusion and death. The death of microglial cells, which normally serve immune functions in the CNS, may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalitis or myelopathy.\",\"Both in vivo and in vitro studies clearly demonstrate that cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage are major hosts for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Presumably these cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). To further delineate the interactions between HIV-1 and host cells, the susceptibility and permissivity of normal human peripheral blood-derived monocyte/macrophages (M/M) and T lymphocytes, and neoplastic monocytoid and lymphoid cell lines to various HIV-1 isolates was assessed. The results suggest: (1) \\\"fresh\\\" isolates recovered from patients and propagated only in normal host cells exhibit a dual tropism for both M/M and T cells, regardless of their tissue of origin or the cell type from which they were isolated; (2) the repeated passage of an HIV-1 isolate through normal M/M does not generally result in the loss of the ability to infect normal T cells nor vice versa; (3) the majority of fresh HIV-1 isolates do not infect neoplastic cells of either origin, and those that do show no preference for monocytoid or lymphoid targets, regardless of their cell origin.\",\"Previously published isolation techniques with T cell blasts and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were used to recover HIV from the PBMC of a group of 23 asymptomatic seropositive individuals. Viral isolation was more readily accomplished by MDM coculture resulting in 9 isolates being obtained exclusively by this method (macrophage tropic strains). To determine the in vivo cellular source of these isolates we separated PBMC from 5 of these 9 patients into T lymphocyte and monocyte fractions by flow microfluorometry. These fractions were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA. In 4 out of these 5 patients HIV-1 proviral DNA could be detected exclusively in T lymphocytes but not in monocytes, although the virus could be isolated only by MDM coculture. In the remaining patient HIV could be amplified in both T lymphocytes and monocytes. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that, among T lymphocytes, only the CD4+ subset was infected with HIV. We conclude that among PBMC the most common in vivo source of HIV strains which preferentially infect macrophages in vitro is the CD4+ T lymphocyte. These data also suggest that the macrophage tropism characteristic of some HIV strains reflects predominantly an in vitro phenomenon.\",\"The outcome of infants born to HIV1 seropositive (HIV1+) mothers is still uncertain is spite of current progress in techniques for viral detection. Using the almost elective tropism of HIV1 virus for CD4 lymphocytes and the central role of these cells in the immune regulation, we studied blood lymphocyte populations with 7 monoclonal antibodies during the first month of life in 28 newborns of HIV1 seropositive mothers. Our data are compared to an age-matched population of 35 control infants. According to our results, the coexistence of a low CD8 lymphocyte percentage together with a high CD4/CD8 ratio seems to be correlated with an unfavourable outcome.\",\"The sera from 16 individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at different clinical stages were evaluated for antibody-dependent neutralization and/or enhancement of infectivity by HIV. The HIV isolate from each individual (homotypic) and established laboratory strains showing broad cellular host range and cytopathicity were used. All sera could neutralize one of the laboratory-passaged isolates, whereas only two could neutralize the corresponding homotypic strain. Seven homotypic isolates were enhanced by serum from the respective individual. This activity was primarily observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Moreover, the tropism for macrophages of four of these seven viral isolates was found to be enhanced by the homotypic sera. Finally, sequential pairs of HIV and sera obtained from five HIV-infected individuals with different clinical progression were studied over time. The enhancing activity of three of the five sera appeared to increase over time, indicating changes in both the host virus population and the type of antibodies produced. These results suggest that enhancing antibodies contribute to the spread and pathogenesis of HIV in vivo. They emphasize the necessity of studying further the association of enhancing antibodies and disease progression in infected individuals.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates were obtained over a 3-year period from blood, brain, and lung of three patients in a clustered infectious outbreak. This included a blood donor who was initially asymptomatic but subsequently developed AIDS-related complex and two neonatal transfusion recipients who developed AIDS. Isolates from brain and lung replicated to greater than 30-fold higher levels in primary monocyte cultures than did those from blood; no growth differences on primary lymphocytes were observed. Thirteen clones were obtained from seven isolates, and env sequences were determined. The predicted amino acid sequences among these clones differed by only 0.01% but differed by 15-27% when compared to previously sequenced isolates from other patients. The level of envelope amino acid sequence divergence noted among these isolates is considerably lower than that previously reported for other human immunodeficiency virus isolates. No differences in the envelope unique to lung or brain isolates compared to blood isolates were noted. This study provides evidence that mutations in the envelope may not be necessary for disease progression and that other portions of the viral genome may contribute to cell-specific tropism.\",\"In view of the current interest in in vivo murine models for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-related retroviruses was investigated with a human leukemic T cell line (PF-382x) that acquired xenotropic MuLV (X-MuLV) after in vivo passage in immunosuppressed mice. Despite similar levels of membrane CD4 expression and HIV-1 125I-labeled gp 120 binding, a dramatic acceleration in the time course of HIV-1 infection was observed in PF-382x compared to its X-MuLV-negative counterpart (PF-382). Moreover, PF-382 cells coinfected by X-MuLV and HIV-1 generated a progeny of phenotypically mixed viral particles, enabling HIV-1 to productively infect a panel of CD4- human cells, including B lymphoid cells and purified normal peripheral blood CD4-/CD8+ T lymphocytes. Mixed viral phenotypes were also produced by human CD4+ T cells coinfected with an amphotropic MuLV-related retrovirus (A-MuLV) and HIV-1. These data show that endogenous MuLV acquired by human cells transplanted into mice can significantly interact with HIV-1, thereby inducing important alterations of HIV-1 biological properties.\",\"Studies have demonstrated that CD4 may be necessary but not sufficient for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Murine cell lines constructed to express the human CD4 glycoprotein demonstrate a restriction in their ability to support infection by the HIV-1 retrovirus. Such restrictions may indicate that molecules in addition to CD4 may be necessary for HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 infectivity has been examined in a panel of murine and human cell lines. It has been demonstrated that CD4 expression allows infectivity on a wide range of human cell lines. Some interspecific hybridomas constructed between human and murine cell lines can, when expressing the human CD4 glycoprotein, become infectable in a manner similar to human cell lines. These studies imply that surface molecules, in addition to CD4, are necessary for HIV-1 entry and infectivity. Such molecules will be important for understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-1.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) produced in the human T lymphoblastoid H9 cell line infected cells of that line more readily than cells of the human monocytoid U937 line. While both cell lines expressed detectable levels of the CD4 molecule on their surfaces, the H9 and U937 cell lines differed in expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens. Both H9 and U937 cells were infected initially with HIV-1 derived from H9 cells. Cell-free culture supernatants were harvested after the cells had been infected for at least 1 month. Culture supernatant from HIV-infected H9 cells was used to infect H9 and U937 cells. Conversely, culture supernatant from HIV-infected U937 cells was used to infect H9 and U937 cells. The percentages of cells infected at each of several time points during the first few days after infection were determined by flow cytometric analysis of cell-associated HIV-1 major core protein p24. Infection of each cell line was more efficient when the cell type infected was identical to that in which the infecting supernatant was produced. However, this difference in tropism was not generated early after infection of each cell line, as might have been expected if this effect were mediated by cell surface molecules acquired during the process of budding through the cell membrane.\",\"Among 100 brains from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 33 brains (21 adults and 12 children) with histological evidence of subacute AIDS encephalitis were immunostained with one of the most sensitive antibodies to HIV-1 antigen, anti-gp41. Twenty-six (20/21 adults, 6/12 children) of the 33 brains showed pg41 positivity. Brains from children had fewer gp41-positive cells than brains from adults. The distribution of gp41-positive cells was characteristic. They were frequently detected and most numerous in the globus pallidus (medial greater than lateral). Although gp41-positive cells were prevalent, fewer were detected in the corpus striatum and thalamus. Of infratentorial areas involved, the ventral midbrain, especially the substantia nigra, and the dentate nucleus contained many positive cells. Lower levels of infections, often patchy, were noted in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter and pontine base. Gp41-positive cells were rarely seen in the cerebral cortex, medulla, spinal cord, leptomeninges, choroid plexus, ependyma, subependymal areas and endothelia. Besides immunoreactive macrophages and multinucleated cells, gp41-positive microglia with various morphological alterations were abundant in the deep cerebral gray matter, ventral midbrain and dentate nucleus. Most of these microglia were undetectable with conventional histological methods. We discuss the significance of the distribution of HIV-1-infected cells, especially microglia, with respect to cellular tropism and involvement of deep gray matter nuclei in a pattern reminiscent of a multisystem atrophy.\",\"NaN\",\"To study biologic properties associated with specific regions of HIV-1, a chimera, pHX-JY1, was constructed by exchanging the vif-env region of a Zairian molecular clone (JY1) with that of pHXB2gpt, a full-length biologically active proviral clone of North American origin. Virus was produced by transfection of permissive cells with parental and recombinant clones, and the biologic and molecular properties of these viruses were compared. Virus derived from pHXB2gpt infected phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD4+ leukemic T cell lines equally well. In contrast, virus derived from pHX-JY1 was transmitted slowly to both PBMC and cell lines, and the infectivity of pHX-JY1 virus was two orders of magnitude greater for PBMC than for T cell lines. All essential viral genes in the exchanged JY1 vif-env region were intact and functioned comparably to those of the parent clone in transfected COS-1 cells. The findings suggest differences in these regions of the HIV-1 genome may play an important role in differential cell tropism.\",\"The biologic, serologic, and molecular properties of isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from the central nervous system (CNS) were determined and compared to those of isolates from peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Among these were pairs of CNS and blood isolates obtained from six infected individuals. The data show that HIV-1 isolates from the CNS can be distinguished from peripheral blood isolates by their (i) relative inability to infect established T-cell lines, (ii) reduced cytopathogenicity, (iii) inability to modulate CD4 antigen expression on infected cells, (iv) efficient replication in peripheral blood macrophages, and (v) insensitivity to serum neutralization. Paired CNS and peripheral blood isolates from the same individual also display some differences in cellular tropism. The blood isolates replicate better in T-cell lines and glioma cell lines, whereas the paired CNS isolates replicate more efficiently in primary macrophages. These results suggest that viruses isolated from the CNS of infected individuals may represent a specific HIV-1 subgroup.\",\"To characterize the host range of different strains of HIV-1, we have used four types of cells, primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), primary PBL, a promonocyte cell line (U937), and a CD4+ T cell line (SUP-T1). These cells were infected with three prototype strains of HIV-1, a putative lymphocyte-tropic strain (IIIB), and two putative monocyte-tropic strains (SF162 and DV). Infections were monitored by assays for infectious virus, for cell-free and cell-associated viral antigen (p24), and for the proportion of cells infected by immunohistochemical staining. It was concluded that: (a) the use of four different cell types provides a useful biological matrix for distinguishing the tropism of different strains of HIV-1; this matrix yields more information than the infection of any single cell type. (b) A monocyte-tropic strain of HIV-1, such as strain SF162, shows a reciprocal host range when compared with a lymphocyte-tropic strain such as IIIB; strain SF162 replicates well in primary MDM but not in U937 or SUP-T1 cells, while strain IIIB replicates well in both U937 and SUP-T1 cells but not in MDM. (c) Both lymphocyte-tropic and monocyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 replicate well in PBL. (d) The promonocyte cell line, U937, and the T cell line, SUP-T1, differ markedly from primary cells, such as MDM and PBL, in their ability to support the replication of different strains of HIV-1; these cell lines cannot be used as surrogates for primary cells in host range studies of HIV-1 strains.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates from various patients were divided into two major groups, rapid/high and slow/low, according to their replication properties in vitro. Rapid/high isolates grow well in cell lines and induce the formation of syncytia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, slow/low isolates do not replicate in cell lines and rarely induce syncytia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To understand the differences in replicative capacity of these isolates, a panel of indicator cell lines was used. These cell lines were generated for sensitive detection of HIV-1 isolates and show characteristics of T-lymphoid or monocytoid cells. As a result of infection, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression is activated. Rapid/high viruses activate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in T-cell and monocytoid indicator cell lines, whereas slow/low isolates activate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression only in monocytoid cell lines. The block in infection of T-lymphoid cells by the slow/low isolates appears to occur early in the infection cycle, prior to the production of the virally encoded tat protein. HIV-1 isolates can thus be distinguished according to target-cell tropism. Monocyte-derived cells seem to be a more general target for the various HIV-1 isolates.\",\"Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is initiated by the binding of its extracellular envelope glycoprotein, gp120, to the CD4 antigen on target cells. To map the residues of the HIV-1 glycoprotein that are critical for binding and to analyse the effects of binding on viral infectivity, we created 15 mutations in a region of gp120 that is important for binding to CD4 (refs 4,5). We find that substitution of a single amino acid (tryptophan at position 432) can abrogate CD4 binding and that virus carrying this mutation is non-infectious. By contrast, other amino-acid changes in the same region do not affect CD4 binding but restrict viral tropism: virions containing isoleucine substitutions at position 425 lose their ability to infect a monocyte cell line (U937 cells) but can still infect T-lymphocyte cell lines (CEM, SUP-T1) and activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results indicate that cellular tropism of HIV can be influenced by a single amino-acid change in gp120.\",\"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, isolated from diverse sources, exhibits genomic diversity. The mechanisms by which the genomic diversity takes place in individuals exposed to multiple virus isolates is yet to be elucidated. Genetic variation, in general, might result from mutagenic events such as point mutations, rearrangements (insertions and deletions), and recombination. In an attempt to evaluate the process of genetic diversity, we designed experiments to analyze recombination between HIV DNAs by using DNA transfection in cell cultures. Here we report the successful recombination between truncated HIV proviral DNAs with an overlap homology of 53 base pairs that leads to the formation of viable hybrid virus. Recombination was also seen between exogenous DNA introduced into cells and homologous HIV sequences resident in the cells. These results indicate that recombination among various HIV isolates may play a significant role in the generation of genetic diversity of HIV. Further, the method used here enables the construction of hybrid HIV genomes to identify the viral determinants responsible for tropism, replication, and cytopathic effects.\",\"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus share the property of tropism for CD4-bearing cells. Infection is initiated by a high-affinity interaction between CD4 and conserved domains on the viral envelope glycoprotein. In this report, we demonstrated that SIV had a restricted host range among human CD4+ cells when compared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or type 2. This restricted tropism was associated with the inability of the SIV envelope glycoprotein to induce membrane fusion in cells not susceptible to productive exogenous infection by SIV. We conclude that the major route of SIV entry into CD4+ cells is by envelope-mediated direct fusion with the cell and that additional envelope-cell interactions after CD4 binding are required for productive infection.\",\"An attenuated vaccinia virus mutant with specific genetic lesions has been used to develop a vehicle for safer live recombinant virus vaccines. The mutant virus 48-7 has an 8-MDa deletion starting 2.2 MDa from the left end of the viral genome and point mutations in the gene encoding the 14-kDa fusion protein that determines the plaque-size phenotype of the virus. Using the highly sensitive reporter gene luciferase, we have shown that this mutant can generate recombinant viruses that infect cultured cells and animals with normal vaccinia virus tropism. Insertion of the envelope and gag genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 into the attenuated vaccinia mutant resulted in their efficient expression and precursor processing in infected cultured cells. Infection of mice with human immunodeficiency virus-vaccinia recombinant viruses elicited human immunodeficiency virus-specific antibodies. Using mice pretreated with cyclophosphamide as a model for immunosuppression, the reduced virulence of the mutant recombinant virus was clearly evident. These findings demonstrate that the highly attenuated vaccinia virus mutant 48-7 can be used to generate effective and safer vaccines.\",\"We investigated the efficiency of HIV isolation from the PBL of 23 healthy, HIV-seropositive individuals with high (600-700/mm3) CD4+ T cell counts. Cocultivations of patients' PBL with allogeneic T lymphocyte blasts or monocytes were performed. T lymphocyte blasts allowed recovery of 4/23 (17%) HIV isolates, whereas monocytes allowed recovery of 12/23 (52%) isolates. Monocyte cultures sustained release of viral antigen for up to 70 days. Nine of the viral isolations could be accomplished only with this monocyte coculture technique. To determine the in vivo source of the macrophage-tropic HIV isolates we separated PBL from 5 of these 9 patients into T lymphocyte and monocyte fractions by cell sorting; then, we analyzed the fractions by PCR to amplify HIV proviral DNA. In 4 out of 5 patients studied HIV-1 proviral DNA was detected only in T lymphocytes but not in monocytes, although the virus was isolated exclusively by monocyte coculture technique. In the remaining patient, HIV DNA was found to be present in both T cells and monocytes. Thus, HIV can be more efficiently isolated in healthy seropositive individuals by coculture of their PBL with normal monocytes rather than T cell blasts. Of note, the most common in vivo source of viral isolates which preferentially infect monocytes in vitro (\\\"macrophage-tropic strains\\\") is the circulating CD4+ T lymphocyte.\",\"Data of the literature about frequency and specificity of giant cells during AIDS encephalitis are conflicting. These discrepancies could be explained by several factors. Envelope glycoprotein Gp 120, when free, induces the formation of giant cells through the fusion of cerebral monocytes. The concentration of this protein depends on the level of its production, function of the quantity and of the maturation of the HIV, and on the rapidity of its catabolism, due to anti-Gp 120 antibodies. On the other hand, the tropism of the virus for monocytes and lymphocytes could vary; this would lead to the formation of giant cells with a different life span. The fusion capability of HIV-2 might be lower on account of the smaller size of its Gp 120. The frequency of mutations in HIV lentivirus leading to the synchronous development of several different clones of HIV-1 in the same patient and the associated infectious diseases, due to risk factors common to the diseased population, current endemic or opportunistic agents, could explain the variability of the density of giant cells according to the country where the patients live.\",\"Naturally occurring HIV variants show distinct biologic features that correspond to the severity of HIV infection. Virus from asymptomatic HIV carriers or individuals with mild disease replicates slowly and inefficiently in the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. Attempts to passage these viruses in CD4-positive cell lines usually fail or result in transient replication only. In contrast, viruses from patients with severe immunodeficiency replicate rapidly and efficiently in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures as well as cell lines: hence the designation slow/low and rapid/high, respectively. These two groups of viruses can also be distinguished by the type of cytopathogenicity exerted in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Rapid/high viruses are characterized by extensive syncytia formation, whereas syncytia are rarely seen with slow/low viruses. Instead cultures infected with slow/low viruses show signs of cell death or no cytopathic changes at all. It has also been observed that shift from the slow/low type of virus to rapid/high may occur in the same individual over time. Whether this change signals the emergence of HIV variants with increased virulence or reflects the damage to the immune system that can no longer control virus replication remains to be seen. Rapid/high and slow/low viruses can also be distinguished by cell tropism when tested in a model system on indicator cell lines of T-lymphoid or monocytoid origin. Infection by rapid/high viruses activates chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in both T-lymphoid and monocytoid indicator cells, whereas slow/low viruses activate chloramphenicol acetyl transferase only in monocytoid cell lines. A difference between slow/low and rapid/high viruses cannot be demonstrated in fresh normal macrophage cultures, since most isolates can be successfully passaged in macrophages. Whether the viruses that infect macrophages are truly macrophage-tropic or dual-tropic, and infect macrophages and lymphocytes with equal efficiency, remains to be studied.\",\"Germinal centers play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-induced lymphadenopathy. Cell-free retrovirus particles, gag proteins of HIV-1, and cells expressing viral RNA can be detected in these areas of the lymph node. In the present study, the ultrastructural changes and the interactions of virus with different cell types of the germinal centers were investigated. We compared the alterations of lymph nodes obtained shortly after seroconversion with those seen in longstanding lymphadenopathy. The results demonstrated that germinal centers were already infected in the early phase of the disease. However, the number of cell free virions was low. During the course of the disease, large amounts of cell free virions accumulated in the germinal centers. The persistence of germinal center infection for up to 2 years was demonstrated by detecting retrovirus particles in repeated biopsy specimens. In addition, the presence of numerous small, moderately electron dense structures that might represent defective particles of HIV-1 and influence the course of the disease were described. HIV-1 was found to replicate in lymphocytes, macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells. Quite possibly, a genomic shift may occur at the time of transmission of the virus to a novel target cell, thus, germinal centers may be one of the anatomic sites where HIV-1 acquires the ability to develop into a variant with preferential tropism for a given cell type.\",\"A cytopathic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolate containing multiple virus genotypes was molecularly cloned, and the biological activity of six randomly selected clones was assessed by transfection into human lymphoid or glial cell lines. Five infectious clones of HIV-1, termed N1T-A through -E, were isolated in this manner. Clones N1T-A, -B, -C, and -E could be distinguished by restriction endonuclease mapping whereas clones N1T-B and -D had identical maps with the enzymes used. Each clone exhibited a distinct host cell range as well as markedly different infection kinetics and cytopathogenic properties when tested in human cell lines of T-lymphocytic, monocytic, and astrocytic origin. In particular, infection with HIV-1 clone N1T-E was characterized by slow kinetics and lack of significant cytopathic effects in acutely and chronically infected cells. Clone N1T-A, similar to the parental isolate N1T, exhibited a wide host cell range, fast kinetics of infection, and high cytopathogenicity. These data indicate that HIV-infected individuals may carry multiple HIV-1 genotypes with distinct cytopathogenic potential and cell tropism. Analysis of virus isolates must take into account the contribution, or masking, of individual virus clones.\",\"Two evolutionarily distinct families of human retroviruses, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and the human T-cell leukaemia viruses (HTLV), have been defined (reviewed in ref. 1). Although these virus groups share tropism for human CD4+ T cells, they differ markedly in primary sequence, genetic organization and disease association (AIDS versus adult T-cell leukaemia), but show similar general strategies for the regulation of viral gene expression. Each encodes a protein able to trans-activate transcription from the homologous viral long terminal repeat (tat in HIV, tax in HTLV), although these proteins act by different mechanisms and do not appear to be interchangeable. Each virus also produces a second trans-acting protein that induces the expression of the unspliced messenger RNAs encoding the viral structural proteins (rev in HIV and rex in HTLV). Here we show that the rex protein of HTLV-I can functionally replace the rev protein of HIV-1 in transient expression assays. This genetic complementation by rex is adequate for the rescue of a replication-defective rev mutant of HIV-1. This unexpected shared function between the structurally distinct rex and rev proteins emphasizes the importance of this highly conserved pathway for the regulation of human retrovirus gene expression.\",\"Some strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can infect primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. In this report, the effect of cytokines on the production of one of these strains that shows a tropism for mononuclear phagocytes, designated HIV-1JR-FL, was studied. Primary peripheral blood mononuclear phagocytes infected with HIV-1JR-FL were treated with the hematopoietic factors: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). The M-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3, and gamma-IFN were able to alter HIV-1 production under different conditions.\",\"We have analyzed a number of biological features of HTLV-IV, a retrovirus indistinguishable from a macaque isolate of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and compared this virus with several strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although HTLV-IV was found to be similar to HIV-1 in its tropism for CD4+ lymphocytes, its effects on CD4 expression and the ability of its externalized envelope molecule to form a complex directly with the CD4 molecule, a number of striking differences were noted. Unlike with HIV-1, the range of cells susceptible to HTLV-IV infection and syncytia formation was restricted to a subset of CD4+ cell lines, particularly those that coexpressed CD4 with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II antigens. An analysis of the patterns of HTLV-IV infection with B x T somatic cell hybrids indicated that for this virus, molecules in addition to CD4 were probably required to facilitate infection and cell fusion. Additional studies of HTLV-IV infection of Sup-T1 cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to cytopathic effects induced by HIV-1, demonstrated that HTLV-IV infection could occur in the absence of cytopathic effects and, remarkably, with minimal or no downmodulation of the CD4 molecule from the cell surface. The failure of HTLV-IV infection to reduce the expression of several CD4 epitopes suggested that the HTLV-IV envelope produced by Sup-T1 cells was altered in its ability to interact with or bind to CD4. Additional differences were also noted in the size of the transmembrane envelope molecule of HTLV-IV produced by Sup-T1 cells, indicating that cell-specific alterations in processing of the HTLV-IV envelope occurred during the production of virus in this cell line. Understanding the basis for these biological differences between HTLV-IV and the HIV-1 viruses may help to elucidate more general mechanisms for pathogenesis of other members of the SIV and HIV families of retroviruses.\",\"Because of the growing incidence of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), the need for studies on animal models is urgent. Infection of chimpanzees with the retroviral agent of human AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), will have only limited usefulness because chimpanzees are in short supply and do not develop the disease. Among non-human primates, both type D retroviruses and lentiviruses can be responsible for immune deficiencies. The D-type retroviruses, although important pathogens in macaque monkey colonies, are not satisfactory as a model because they differ in genetic structure and pathophysiological properties from the human AIDS viruses. The simian lentivirus, previously referred to as simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (STLV-III), now termed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is related to HIV by the antigenicity of its proteins and in its main biological properties, such as cytopathic effect and tropism for CD4-bearing cells. Most importantly, SIV induces a disease with remarkable similarity to human AIDS in the common rhesus macaques, which therefore constitute the best animal model currently available. Natural or experimental infection of other monkeys such as African green monkeys or sooty mangabeys has not yet been associated with disease. Molecular approaches of the SIV system will be needed for biological studies and development of vaccines that could be tested in animals. We have cloned and sequenced the complete genome of SIV isolated from a naturally infected macaque that died of AIDS. This SIVMAC appears genetically close to the agent of AIDS in West Africa, HIV-2, but the divergence of the sequences of SIV and HIV-2 is greater than that previously observed between HIV-1 isolates.\"],\"authors\":[\"Peng,Xu,Huang,Zhu\",\"Mendoza-Olivas,Niembro-Ortega,Sierra-Madero,Soto-Ram\\u00edrez,Rodr\\u00edguez-D\\u00edaz,Fuentes-Romero,Hern\\u00e1ndez-Flores,Hern\\u00e1ndez-Mart\\u00ednez,Trevi\\u00f1o-Frenk,Chiquete\",\"Moeser,Nielsen,Joseph\",\"Connell,Hermans,Wensing,Schellens,Schipper,van
